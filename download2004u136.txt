TI Genetic variability and drift load in populations of an aquatic snail.
SO Evolution; international journal of organic evolution
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB Population genetic theory predicts that in small populations, random genetic  drift will fix and accumulate slightly deleterious mutations, resulting in  reduced reproductive output. This genetic load due to random drift (i.e., drift  load) can increase the extinction risk of small populations. We studied the  relationship between genetic variability (indicator of past population size) and  reproductive output in eight isolated, natural populations of the hermaphroditic  snail Lymnaea stagnalis. In a common laboratory environment, snails from  populations with the lowest genetic variability mature slower and have lower  fecundity than snails from genetically more variable populations. This result  suggests that past small population size has resulted in increased drift load, as  predicted. The relationship between genetic variability and reproductive output  is independent of the amount of nonrandom mating within populations. However,  reproductive output and the current density of snails in the populations were not  correlated. Instead, data from the natural populations suggest that trematode  parasites may determine, at least in part, population densities of the snails.

TI Crocodyliform biogeography during the Cretaceous: evidence of Gondwanan
SO Proceedings. Biological sciences
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB Explanations of the distributions of terrestrial vertebrates during the Mesozoic  are currently vigorously contested and debated in palaeobiogeography. Recent  studies focusing on dinosaurs yield conflicting hypotheses. Dispersal, coupled  with regional extinction or vicariance driven by continental break-up, have been  cited as the main causal factors behind dinosaur distributions in the Mesozoic.  To expand the scope of the debate and test for vicariance within another  terrestrial group, I herein apply a cladistic biogeographical method to a large  sample of Cretaceous crocodyliform taxa. A time-slicing methodology is employed  and a refinement made to account for the divergence times of the analysed clades.  The results provide statistically significant evidence that Gondwana  fragmentation affected crocodyliform diversification during the Mid-Late  Cretaceous. Detection of a vicariant pattern within crocodyliforms is important  as it helps corroborate vicariance hypotheses in other fossil and extant groups  as well as furthers the move towards more taxonomically diverse approaches to  palaeobiogeographical research.

TI Estimation of melanin and hemoglobin in skin tissue using multiple regression
SO Journal of biomedical optics
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB To estimate the concentrations of melanin and blood and the oxygen saturation in  human skin tissue, we propose a method using a multiple regression analysis aided  by a Monte Carlo simulation for diffuse reflectance spectra from the skin tissue.  By using the absorbance spectrum as a response variable and the extinction  coefficients of melanin, oxygenated hemoglobin, and deoxygenated hemoglobin as  predictor variables, the multiple regression analysis gives regression  coefficients. The concentrations of melanin and blood are determined from the  regression coefficients using conversion vectors that are estimated numerically  in advance, while the oxygen saturation is obtained directly from the regression  coefficients. Numerical and experimental investigations were performed for  layered skin tissue models and phantoms. Measurements of human skin were also  carried out to monitor variations in the melanin and blood contents and  oxygenation during cuff occlusion. The results confirmed the usefulness of the  proposed method.

TI Is telomere erosion a mechanism of species extinction?
SO Journal of experimental zoology. Part B, Molecular and developmental evolution
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB According to the fossil record, 99.9% of all species that have ever lived on  Earth have disappeared. However, only about 4% died out during the five mass  extinction events, whereas it seems that the majority of species vanished without  any signs of significant earthbound or extraterrestrial physical threats.  Clearly, biological extinction mechanisms are by far the most important, but they  are subject to serious limitations concerning the worldwide disappearance of  species. In view of that, species-inherent mechanisms, which could lead to the  worldwide destabilization of a population, might be worth reconsideration.  Telomeres, the protective caps of chromosome ends, and the enzyme telomerase have  been well preserved in plants and animals during evolution. In the absence of  telomerase activity, telomeric DNA has been shown to shorten every time a cell  divides. The concept of a mitotic clock based on the gradual erosion of telomeres  is now generally accepted and has been confirmed in numerous plants and animals.  Chromosomal rearrangements are the hallmarks of two completely different  biological phenomena, cancer and speciation. In premalignant cells, gradual  telomere erosion beyond a critical threshold is a well-known inducer of  chromosomal instability. The species clock hypothesis, as presented here, is  based on the idea of a tiny loss of mean telomere length per generation. This  mechanism would not rapidly endanger the survival of a particular species. Yet,  after many thousands of generations, critically short telomeres could lead to the  weakening and even the extinction of old species and would simultaneously create  the unstable chromosomal environment that might result in the origination of new  species.

TI Application of Johnson et al.'s speciation threshold model to apparent
SO Evolution; international journal of organic evolution
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB Understanding patterns of diversity can be furthered by analysis of the dynamics  of colonization, speciation, and extinction on islands using historical  information provided by molecular phylogeography. The land birds of the Lesser  Antilles are one of the most thoroughly described regional faunas in this  context. In an analysis of colonization times, Ricklefs and Bermingham (2001)  found that the cumulative distribution of lineages with respect to increasing  time since colonization exhibits a striking change in slope at a genetic distance  of about 2% mitochondrial DNA sequence divergence (about one million years). They  further showed how this heterogeneity could be explained by either an abrupt  increase in colonization rates or a mass extinction event. Cherry et al. (2002),  referring to a model developed by Johnson et al. (2000), argued instead that the  pattern resulted from a speciation threshold for reproductive isolation of island  populations from their continental source populations. Prior to this threshold,  genetic divergence is slowed by migration from the source, and species of varying  age accumulate at a low genetic distance. After the threshold is reached, source  and island populations diverge more rapidly, creating heterogeneity in the  distribution of apparent ages of island taxa. We simulated of Johnson et al.'s  speciation-threshold model, incorporating genetic divergence at rate k and  fixation at rate M of genes that have migrated between the source and the island  population. Fixation resets the divergence clock to zero. The  speciation-threshold model fits the distribution of divergence times of Lesser  Antillean birds well with biologically plausible parameter estimates. Application  of the model to the Hawaiian avifauna, which does not exhibit marked  heterogeneity of genetic divergence, and the West Indian herpetofauna, which  does, required unreasonably high migration-fixation rates, several orders of  magnitude greater than the colonization rate. However, the plausibility of the  speciation-divergence model for Lesser Antillean birds emphasizes the importance  of further investigation of historical biogeography on a regional scale for whole  biotas, as well as the migration of genes between populations on long time scales  and the achievement of reproductive isolation.

TI Coexistence of multiple pathogen strains in stochastic epidemic models with
SO Bulletin of mathematical biology
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB Stochastic differential equations that model an SIS epidemic with multiple  pathogen strains are derived from a system of ordinary differential equations.  The stochastic model assumes there is demographic variability. The dynamics of  the deterministic model are summarized. Then the dynamics of the stochastic model  are compared to the deterministic model. In the deterministic model, there can be  either disease extinction, competitive exclusion, where only one strain persists,  or coexistence, where more than one strain persists. In the stochastic model, all  strains are eventually eliminated because the disease-free state is an absorbing  state. However, if the population size and the initial number of infected  individuals are sufficiently large, it may take a long time until all strains are  eliminated. Numerical simulations of the stochastic model show that coexistence  cases predicted by the deterministic model are an unlikely occurrence in the  stochastic model even for short time periods. In the stochastic model, either  disease extinction or competitive exclusion occur. The initial number of infected  individuals, the basic reproduction numbers, and other epidemiological parameters  are important determinants of the dominant strain in the stochastic epidemic  model.

TI Sex causes altruism. Altruism causes sex. Maybe.
SO Proceedings. Biological sciences
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB This study presents a mathematical model in which the fitness of an individual  depends on the individual's genotype (individual effects) and on the genotypes of  other members of the individual's local group (group effects). The findings  suggest that, if phenotypes are a result of complex interactions between genes at  different loci, then fitness-enhancing group effects may become common in sexual  populations. The spread of fitness-enhancing group effects is facilitated when  environmental conditions sometimes deteriorate temporarily. This is so even if  the genotypes with the highest group effects also tend to have relatively low  individual effects. In this sense, the process described here can lead to the  evolution of altruism. By contrast, when populations are asexual it appears that  group effects are much less important in determining the outcome of evolution.  Thus, in nature, asexual populations may tend to be characterized by more  antagonistic interactions than those that typically prevail when reproduction is  sexual. This might help to explain why asexual lineages are prone to rapid  extinction.

TI Evolution of Wolbachia cytoplasmic incompatibility types.
SO Evolution; international journal of organic evolution
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB The success of obligate endosymbiotic Wolbachia infections in insects is due in  part to cytoplasmic incompatibility (CI), whereby Wolbachia bacteria manipulate  host reproduction to promote their invasion and persistence within insect  populations. The observed diversity of CI types raises the question of what the  evolutionary pathways are by which a new CI type can evolve from an ancestral  type. Prior evolutionary models assume that Wolbachia exists within a host  individual as a clonal infection. While endosymbiotic theory predicts a general  trend toward clonality, Wolbachia provides an exception in which there is  selection to maintain diversity. Here, evolutionary trajectories are discussed  that assume that a novel Wolbachia variant will co-exist with the original  infection type within a host individual as a superinfection. Relative to prior  models, this assumption relaxes requirements and allows additional pathways for  the evolution of novel CI types. In addition to describing changes in the  Wolbachia infection frequency associated with the hypothesized evolutionary  events, the predicted impact of novel CI variants on the host population is also  described. This impact, resulting from discordant evolutionary interests of  symbiont and host, is discussed as a possible cause of Wolbachia loss from the  host population or host population extinction. The latter is also discussed as  the basis for an applied strategy for the suppression of insect pest populations.  Model predictions are discussed relative to a recently published Wolbachia genome  sequence and prior characterization of CI in naturally and artificially infected  insects.

Although we acknowledge the efforts that they  make to measure the uncertainties associated with different climate scenarios,  species' dispersal abilities and z values (predictions ranged from 5.6% to 78.6%  extinctions), we find that two additional sources of uncertainty may  substantially increase the variability in predictions.

TI Differential fitness of mitochondrial DNA in perturbation cage studies correlates
SO Proceedings. Biological sciences
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB Mitochondria are often referred to as the powerhouse of the cell. However,  research linking intraspecific differences in organismal fitness with genotypic  mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) variation has been hampered by the lack of variation in  experimentally tractable species. This study examines whether fly lines  harbouring three distinct Drosophila simulans mtDNA types (siI, -II and -III)  exhibit differential fitness in laboratory perturbation cages. Comparison of the  pre-perturbation and post-perturbation data shows that both the mtDNA and  mitonuclear interactions have a significant and repeatable effect on the  frequency of flies with specific genotypes in population cages (siII > -III > -I)  and that coadapted mitonuclear interactions are greatest in the siI type. The  rank order of mtDNA frequency correlates with the observed worldwide distribution  of the haplogroups while mitonuclear interactions are most significant in the siI  haplogroup that is likely to have been subject to repeated population  bottlenecks. One possible explanation for the maintenance of the least fit siI  haplogroup on Pacific islands is that it is protected from extinction by  Wolbachia infection.

SO Nature

DT Journal Article
AB The mass extinction at the Permian-Triassic boundary, 251 million years (Myr)  ago, is accepted as the most profound loss of life on record. Global data  compilations indicate a loss of 50% of families or more, both in the sea and on  land, and these figures scale to a loss of 80-96% of species, based on  rarefaction analyses. This level of loss is confirmed by local and regional-scale  studies of marine sections, but the terrestrial record has been harder to analyse  in such close detail. Here we document the nature of the event in Russia in a  comprehensive survey of 675 specimens of amphibians and reptiles from 289  localities spanning 13 successive geological time zones in the South Urals basin.  These changes in diversity and turnover cannot be explained simply by sampling  effects. There was a profound loss of genera and families, and simplification of  ecosystems, with the loss of small fish-eaters and insect-eaters, medium and  large herbivores and large carnivores. Faunal dynamics also changed, from high  rates of turnover through the Late Permian period to greater stability at low  diversity through the Early Triassic period. Even after 15 Myr of ecosystem  rebuilding, some guilds were apparently still absent-small fish-eaters, small  insect-eaters, large herbivores and top carnivores.

TI Environmental versus genetic sex determination: a possible factor in dinosaur
SO Fertility and sterility
LA English
DT Review
AB This study examined the possibility that genetically based sex-determination  mechanisms have evolved to ensure a balanced male/female ratio and that this  temperature-independent checkpoint might have been unavailable to long-extinct  reptiles, notably the dinosaurs. A review of the literature on molecular and  phylogenetic relationships between modes of reproduction and sex determination in  extant animals was conducted. Mammals, birds, all snakes and most lizards,  amphibians, and some gonochoristic fish use specific sex-determining chromosomes  or genes (genetic sex determination, GSD). Some reptiles, however, including all  crocodilians studied to date, many turtle and tortoise species, and some lizards,  use environmental or temperature-dependent sex determination (TSD). We show that  various modes of GSD have evolved many times, independently in different orders.  Animals using TSD would be at risk of rapid reproductive failure due to a skewed  sex ratio favoring males in response to sustained environmental temperature  change and favoring the selection of sex-determining genes. The disadvantage to  the evolving male sex-determining chromosome, however, is its decay due to  nonrecombination and the subsequent loss of spermatogenesis genes. Global  temperature change can skew the sex ratio of TSD animals and might have played a  significant role in the demise of long-extinct species, notably the dinosaurs,  particularly if the temperature change resulted in a preponderance of males.  Current global warming also represents a risk for extant TSD species.

TI Most species are not driven to extinction before genetic factors impact them.
SO Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB There is controversy concerning the role of genetic factors in species  extinctions. Many authors have asserted that species are usually driven to  extinction before genetic factors have time to impact them, but few studies have  seriously addressed this issue. If this assertion is true, there will be little  difference in genetic diversity between threatened and taxonomically related  nonthreatened species. We compared average heterozygosities in 170 threatened  taxa with those in taxonomically related nonthreatened taxa in a comprehensive  metaanalysis. Heterozygosity was lower in threatened taxa in 77% of comparisons,  a highly significant departure from the predictions of the no genetic impact  hypothesis. Heterozygosity was on average 35% lower (median 40%) in threatened  taxa than in related nonthreatened ones. These differences in heterozygosity  indicate lowered evolutionary potential, compromised reproductive fitness, and  elevated extinction risk in the wild. Independent evidence from stochastic  computer projections has demonstrated that inbreeding depression elevates  extinction risk for threatened species in natural habitats when all other  threatening processes are included in the models. Thus, most taxa are not driven  to extinction before genetic factors affect them adversely.

TI Extinction times and moment closure in the stochastic logistic process.
SO Theoretical population biology
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB We investigate the statistics of extinction times for an isolated population,  with an initially modest number M of individuals, whose dynamics are controlled  by a stochastic logistic process (SLP). The coefficient of variation in the  extinction time V is found to have a maximum value when the death and birth rates  are close in value. For large habitat size K we find that Vmax is of order K1/4 /  M1/2, which is much larger than unity so long as M is small compared to K1/2. We  also present a study of the SLP using the moment closure approximation (MCA), and  discuss the successes and failures of this method. Regarding the former, the MCA  yields a steady-state distribution for the population when the death rate is low.  Although not correct for the SLP model, the first three moments of this  distribution coincide with those calculated exactly for an adjusted SLP in which  extinction is forbidden. These exact calculations also pinpoint the breakdown of  the MCA as the death rate is increased.

TI Distinct roles of hippocampal de novo protein synthesis and actin rearrangement
SO The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB It is believed that de novo protein synthesis is fundamentally linked to synaptic  changes in neuronal circuits involved in acquisition and extinction of  conditioned responses. Recent studies show that neuronal plasticity may be also  altered by cytoskeletal rearrangement independently of protein synthesis. We  investigated the role of these processes in the hippocampus during acquisition  and extinction of context-dependent conditioned fear in mice. Intrahippocampal  injections of the protein synthesis inhibitors anisomycin and puromycin, or of  the actin rearrangement inhibitors cytochalasin D and latrunculin A, prevented  the acquisition of context-dependent fear. Unexpectedly, anisomycin and puromycin  enhanced extinction without erasing the fear memory. In contrast, cytochalasin D  and latrunculin A prevented extinction of context-dependent freezing. On the  basis of these findings, it is suggested that certain hippocampal mechanisms  mediating extinction of conditioned contextual fear are inhibited by protein  synthesis and involve actin rearrangement. Such mechanisms might predominantly  elicit modifications of hippocampal circuits that store the conditioning memory.

TI Effects of training on neuronal activity and interactions in primary and higher
SO The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB The effects of behavioral training on early visual representations have been  elusive when assessed with firing rates. Learning-induced changes in performance,  however, suggest that representations should encompass early cortical stages.  Here, we address the question of whether training-induced effects are pertinent  to neuronal activity outside the task proper, which is a requirement if  subsequent perceptional processes should profit from training. To search for a  neuronal signature of training effects beyond firing rates, we measured local  field potentials, multiunit and isolated spike activity during passive viewing of  previously learned stimulus response associations (S+ and S-) in areas 17/18 and  21a of two alert cats. Evoked potential responses as well as gamma oscillations  even during the first 200 msec were found to be stronger for S+ in both areas.  Most importantly, the later parts of the response (>200 msec) not only exhibit a  highly significant difference in coherent gamma oscillations for S+ and S- both  within and across areas, but are also characterized by a pronounced preference in  firing rate for S+ in area 21a, whereas primary cortex shows a nonsignificant  trend for weaker spike responses. From these results, we conclude that  training-induced plasticity occurs in adult visual cortex for behaviorally  relevant stimuli by changing primarily the temporal structure of neuronal  activity at early stages of cortical processing, whereas later stages of cortical  processing express the increased coherence of their input in elevated firing  rates.

TI Who dominates whom in the ecosystem? Energy flow bottlenecks and cascading
SO Journal of theoretical biology
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB In this paper, we investigate the problem of secondary extinction in food webs  through the use of dominator trees, network topological structures that reduce  food webs to linear pathways that are essential for energy delivery. Each species  along these chains is responsible for passing energy to the taxa that follow it,  and, as such, it is indispensable for their survival; because of this it is said  to dominate them. The higher the number of species a node dominates, the greater  the impact resulting from its removal. By computing dominator trees for 13  well-studied food webs we obtained for each of them the number of nodes dominated  by a single species and the number of nodes that dominate each species. We  illustrate the procedure for the Grassland Ecosystem showing the potential of  this method for identifying species that play a major role in energy delivery and  are likely to cause the greatest damage if removed. Finally, by means of two  indices that measure error and attack sensitivity, we confirm a previous  hypothesis that food webs are very robust to random loss of species but very  fragile to the selective loss of the hubs.

TI Genome size and extinction risk in vertebrates.
SO Proceedings. Biological sciences
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB The hypothesis of 'selfish DNA' is tested for the case of animals using the  relation between genome size and conservation status of a given species. In  contrast to plants, where the larger genome was previously shown to increase the  likelihood of extinction, the picture is more complicated in animals. At the  within-families and within-orders levels, the larger genome increases the risk of  extinction only in reptiles and birds (which have the smallest genomes among  tetrapods). In fishes and amphibians, the effect is caused by the higher  taxonomic levels (above order). In several phylogenetic lineages of anamniotes,  there is a correlation between a higher fraction of threatened species and a  lower number of extant species in a lineage with the larger genome. In mammals,  no effect was observed at any taxonomic level. The obtained data support the  concept of hierarchical selection. It is also shown that, in plants and reptiles,  the probability of being threatened increases from less than 10% to more than 80%  with the increase in genome size, which can help in establishing conservation  priorities.

TI Dispersal and the evolution of specialisation in a two-habitat type
SO Theoretical population biology
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB Metapopulation theory for the evolution of specialisation is virtually absent. In  this article, therefore, we study a metapopulation model for consumers with a  fitness trade-off between two habitats. We focus on effects of habitat abundance,  dispersal rate and trade-off strength on the evolution of specialisation under  two types of trade-off. Adaptation affects either the intrinsic growth rates r or  the carrying capacities K. Depending on dispersal rate and trade-off strength,  evolution can result in one generalist, one specialist or two specialist types.  Higher dispersal rate and a weaker trade-off favour the evolution of a  generalist, for both trade-off structures. However, we also find differences  between the two trade-off structures. Our results are qualitatively similar to  analyses of two-patch models, suggesting that insights from such simpler models  can be extrapolated to metapopulation models. Additional effects, however, occur  because in classical metapopulations patch lifetime depends on extinction rate.  Counterintuitively, this favours the evolution of specialisation when the  trade-off affects r.

TI Evolutionary stability of mutualism: interspecific population regulation as an
SO Proceedings. Biological sciences
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB Interspecific mutualisms are often vulnerable to instability because low benefit  : cost ratios can rapidly lead to extinction or to the conversion of mutualism to  parasite-host or predator-prey interactions. We hypothesize that the evolutionary  stability of mutualism can depend on how benefits and costs to one mutualist vary  with the population density of its partner, and that stability can be maintained  if a mutualist can influence demographic rates and regulate the population  density of its partner. We test this hypothesis in a model of mutualism with key  features of senita cactus (Pachycereus schottii)-senita moth (Upiga virescens)  interactions, in which benefits of pollination and costs of larval seed  consumption to plant fitness depend on pollinator density. We show that plants  can maximize their fitness by allocating resources to the production of excess  flowers at the expense of fruit. Fruit abortion resulting from excess flower  production reduces pre-adult survival of the pollinating seed-consumer, and  maintains its density beneath a threshold that would destabilize the mutualism.  Such a strategy of excess flower production and fruit abortion is convergent and  evolutionarily stable against invasion by cheater plants that produce few flowers  and abort few to no fruit. This novel mechanism of achieving evolutionarily  stable mutualism, namely interspecific population regulation, is qualitatively  different from other mechanisms invoking partner choice or selective rewards, and  may be a general process that helps to preserve mutualistic interactions in  nature.

TI Allee-like effects in metapopulation dynamics.
SO Mathematical biosciences
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB The existences of the Allee effect at the local population level and of the  Allee-like effect at the metapopulation level are important for both ecology and  conservation. Although there have been a great many papers on the Allee effect,  they have mainly referred to only local populations and have not dealt with the  relationship between the two. In this paper, we begin with local population  dynamics and then construct a model including both local population and  metapopulation dynamics. Then we simulate with computer at these two levels. The  results indicate that the Allee-like effect in a metapopulation may emerge from  the imposed Allee effect at the local population level. This threshold fraction  of occupied patches below which the metapopulation goes extinct is seriously  affected by the per capita migration rate, the survival rate during migration and  the initial population size on the occupied patches. We also find that severe  demographic stochasticity may compound the metapopulation extinction risk posed  by the Allee effect. These conclusions are helpful for nature conservation,  especially for the preservation of rare species.

TI Habitat destruction in mutualistic metacommunities.
SO Theoretical population biology
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB We investigate a mutualistic metacommunity where the strength of the mutualistic  interaction between species is measured by the extent to which the presence of  one species on a patch either reduces the extinction rate of the others present  on the same patch or increases their ability to colonize other patches. In both  cases, a strong enough mutualism enables all species to persist at habitat  densities where they would all be extinct in the absence of the interaction.  However, a mutualistic interaction that enhances colonization enables the species  to persist at lower habitat density than one that suppresses extinction. All  species abruptly go extinct (catastrophe) when the habitat density is decreased  infinitesimally below a critical value. A comparison of the mean field or  spatially implicit case with unrestricted dispersal and colonization to all  patches in the system with a spatially explicit case where dispersal is  restricted to the immediate neighbours of the original patch leads to the  intriguing conclusion that restricted dispersal can be favourable for species  that have a beneficial effect on each other when habitat conditions are adverse.  When the mutualistic interaction is strong enough, the extinction threshold or  critical amount of habitat required for the persistence of all species is lower  when the dispersal is locally restricted than when unrestricted ! The persistence  advantage for all species created by the mutualistic interaction increases  substantially with the number of species in the metacommunity, as does the  advantage for restricted dispersal over global dispersal.

AB OBJECTIVE: To study the feasibility of the establishment of the orthotopic  transplantation tumor model of hepatocellular carcinoma in mice and its tumor  biological characteristics. METHODS: H22 cells of hepatocellular carcinoma were  inoculated to form ectopic transplanted model in mice by subcutaneous injection.  Then the subcutaneous tumors were implanted into the liver of mice, and the  orthotopic transplantation tumor model of hepatocellular carcinoma was  established. RESULTS: The successful rate of the orthotopic transplantation tumor  model was 95.6% and the spontaneous metastatic rate was 81.8%, the rate of mass  ascites was 40.9% and the natural extinctive rate was 0%. The natural survival  time in the orthotopic transplantation tumor model was 28 days and the  proliferation of tumor in transplanted model was accelerated after 2 weeks or so.  CONCLUSION: The orthotopic transplantation tumor model in mice is an ideal model  for studying the metastatic mechanism and screening anti-tumor drugs for liver  cancer, just because of its high successful rate and high spontaneous metastatic  rate with no natural extinction.

AB In this paper, the dynamic behaviour of a classical periodic Lotka-Volterra  competing system with impulsive effect is investigated. By applying the Floquet  theory of linear periodic impulsive equations, some conditions are obtained for  the linear stability of the trivial and semi-trivial periodic solutions. It is  proved that the system can be permanent if all the trivial and semi-trivial  periodic solutions are linearly unstable. We use standard bifurcation theory to  show the existence of nontrivial periodic solutions which arise near the  semi-trivial periodic solution. As an application, a fish harvest problem is  considered. We explain how two competing species, one of which in a periodic  environment without impulsive effect would be doomed to extinction, can coexist  with suitably periodic impulsive harvesting.

TI Geographic variation in patterns of nestedness among local stream fish
SO Oecologia
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB Nestedness of faunal assemblages is a multi-scale phenomenon, potentially  influenced by a variety of factors. Prior small-scale studies have found  freshwater fish species assemblages to be nested along stream courses as a result  of either selective colonization or extinction. However, within-stream gradients  in temperature and other factors are correlated with the distributions of many  fish species and may also contribute to nestedness. At a regional level, strongly  nested patterns would require a consistent set of structuring mechanisms across  streams, and correlation among species' tolerances of the environmental factors  that influence distribution. Thus, nestedness should be negatively associated  with the spatial extent of the region analyzed and positively associated with  elevational gradients (a correlate of temperature and other environmental  factors). We examined these relationships for the freshwater fishes of Virginia.  Regions were defined within a spatial hierarchy and included whole river  drainages, portions of drainages within physiographic provinces, and smaller  subdrainages. In most cases, nestedness was significantly stronger in regions of  smaller spatial extent and in regions characterized by greater topographic  relief. Analysis of hydrologic variability and patterns of faunal turnover  provided no evidence that inter-annual colonization/extinction dynamics  contributed to elevational differences in nestedness. These results suggest that,  at regional scales, nestedness is influenced by interactions between biotic and  abiotic factors, and that the strongest nestedness is likely to occur where a  small number of organizational processes predominate, i.show $132#e., over small  spatial extents and regions exhibiting strong environmental gradients.

TI Modeling and analysis of stoichiometric two-patch consumer-resource systems.
SO Mathematical biosciences
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB Ecological stoichiometry studies the balance of energy and multiple chemical  elements in ecological interactions to establish how the laws of thermodynamics  affect food-web dynamics and nutrient cycling in ecosystems. In this paper, we  incorporate stoichiometric principles in a model with habitat heterogeneity and  dispersal in order to better understand population growth dynamics. This model  describes a situation where a resource is separated into two patches by a  barrier. Growth of the resource in each patch is limited by soil fertility and  self-crowding. The consumer disperses between the two patches and is not affected  by the barrier. The consumer's growth is potentially limited by the phosphorus  content of the acquired resource. Mathematical analysis of this model and  simulations are performed. Several biological implications, including an observed  "stoichiometric extinction effect," are demonstrated with simulation where the  stoichiometric mechanism appears to promote extinction in a patchy environment.  This is in sharp contrast to the notion that stoichiometry mechanism promotes  diversity in spatially homogeneous settings. Another important result is the  rediscovery of a simple and plausible biological mechanism that generates local  and global extinction. In this setting, which can be considered a spatially  mediated form of apparent competition, the dispersal of the consumer from the  rich patch can des the growth of the resource in the poor patch and in some  situations can lead to the extinction of the resource in the poor patch.

TI Genetic variability and founder effect in the pitcher plant Sarracenia purpurea
SO Annals of botany
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The long-lived and mainly outcrossing species Sarracenia  purpurea has been introduced into Switzerland and become invasive. This creates  the opportunity to study reactions to founder effect and how a species can  circumvent deleterious effects of bottlenecks such as reduced genetic diversity,  inbreeding and extinction through mutational meltdown, to emerge as a highly  invasive plant. METHODS: A population genetic survey by random amplified  polymorphism DNA markers (RAPD) together with historical insights and a field  pollination experiment were carried out. KEY RESULTS: At the regional scale, S.  purpurea shows low structure (thetast=0.072) due to a recent founder event and  important subsequent growth. Nevertheless, multivariate statistical analyses  reveal that, because of a bottleneck that shifted allele frequencies, most of the  variability is independent among populations. In one population (Tenasses) the  species has become invasive and genetic analysis reveals restricted gene flow and  family structure (thetast=0.287). Although inbreeding appears to be high (Fis  >0.410 from a Bayesian estimation), a field pollination experiment failed to  detect significant inbreeding depression upon F1 seed number and seed weight  fitness-traits. Furthermore, crosses between unrelated individuals produced F1  seeds with significantly reduced fitness, thus showing local outbreeding  depression. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that, under restricted gene flow  among families, the species may not only have rapidly purged deleterious alleles,  but also have undergone some form of selection for inbreeding due to  co-adaptation between loci.

AB Novel antimicrobial peptides (AMP), designated Tu-AMP 1 and Tu-AMP 2, were  purified from the bulbs of tulip (Tulipa gesneriana L.) by chitin affinity  chromatography and reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC).  They bind to chitin in a reversible way. They were basic peptides having  isoelectric points of over 12. Tu-AMP 1 and Tu-AMP 2 had molecular masses of  4,988 Da and 5,006 Da on MALDI-TOF MS analysis, and their extinction coefficients  of 1% aqueous solutions at 280 nm were 3.3 and 3.4, respectively. Half of all  amino acid residues of Tu-AMP 1 and Tu-AMP 2 were occupied by cysteine, arginine,  lysine, and proline. The concentrations of peptides required for 50% inhibition  (IC(50)) of the growth of plant pathogenic bacteria and fungi were 2 to 20  microg/ml. The structural characteristics of Tu-AMP 1 and Tu-AMP 2 indicated that  they were novel thionin-like antimicrobial peptides, though Tu-AMP 2 was a  heterodimer composes of two short peptides joined with disulfide bonds.

TI A branching model for the spread of infectious animal diseases in varying
SO Journal of mathematical biology
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB This paper is concerned with a stochastic model, describing outbreaks of  infectious diseases that have potentially great animal or human health  consequences, and which can result in such severe economic losses that immediate  sets of measures need to be taken to curb the spread. During an outbreak of such  a disease, the environment that the infectious agent experiences is therefore  changing due to the subsequent control measures taken. In our model, we introduce  a general branching process in a changing (but not random) environment. With this  branching process, we estimate the probability of extinction and the expected  number of infected individuals for different control measures. We also use this  branching process to calculate the generating function of the number of infected  individuals at any given moment. The model and methods are designed using  important infections of farmed animals, such as classical swine fever,  foot-and-mouth disease and avian influenza as motivating examples, but have a  wider application, for example to emerging human infections that lead to strict  quarantine of cases and suspected cases (e.g. SARS) and contact and movement  restrictions.

TI Lost in time, lonely, and single: reproductive asynchrony and the Allee effect.
SO The American naturalist
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB Identifying linkages between life-history traits and small population processes  is essential to effective multispecies conservation. Reproductive asynchrony,  which occurs when individuals are reproductively active for only a portion of the  population-level breeding period, may provide one such link. Traditionally,  reproductive asynchrony has been considered from evolutionary perspectives as an  advantageous bet-hedging strategy in temporally unpredictable environments. Here,  we explore the dynamic consequences of reproductive asynchrony as a  density-dependent life-history trait. To examine how asynchrony affects  population growth rate and extinction risk, we used a general model of  reproductive timing to quantify the temporal overlap of opposite-sex individuals  and to simulate population dynamics over a range of initial densities and  empirical estimates of reproductive asynchrony. We also considered how protandry,  a sexually selected life-history strategy that often accompanies asynchrony,  modulates the population-level effects of reproductive asynchrony. We found that  asynchrony decreases the number of males a female overlaps with, decreases the  average probability of mating per male/female pair that does overlap, and leaves  some females completely isolated in time. This loss of reproductive potential,  which is exacerbated by protandry, reduces population growth rate at low density  and can lead to extinction via an Allee effect. Thus reproductive asynchrony and  protandry, both of which can be evolutionarily advantageous at higher population  densities, may prove detrimental when population density declines.

SO Die Naturwissenschaften
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB A temnospondyl ilium from the uppermost Toutunhe Formation (Middle Jurassic,  Callovian) of the southern Junggar Basin is described. Among the known  temnospondyls it is very unusual in morphology because of its very long and  slender shaft. It compares closely only to the ilium of one of the latest known  trematosaurids from the Ladinian of southern Germany. The Toutunhe Formation has  also yielded vertebrae and skull fragments of temnospondyls which belong to the  brachyopid Gobiops from the Upper Jurassic of Mongolia. Brachyopoid ilia do not,  however, display a morphology similar to that of the new specimen. It is  therefore concluded that this specimen represents a second taxon of temnospondyl  from the Toutunhe Formation, which probably represents the latest surviving  trematosauroid. The Trematosauroidea, which was hitherto exclusively known from  the Lower to early Upper Triassic, therefore joins the Brachyopoidea--and  possibly the Capitosauroidea --as another group of temnospondyls which survived  the end--Triassic mass extinction.

TI Cosmopolitan metapopulations of free-living microbial eukaryotes.
SO Protist
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB Metapopulations of macroscopic organisms tend to be geographically restricted,  but free-living protists and other microbial eukaryotes present a different  picture. Here we show that most organisms smaller than 1 mm occur worldwide  wherever their required habitats are realised. This is a consequence of  ubiquitous dispersal driven by huge population sizes, and the consequently low  probability of local extinction. Organisms larger than 10 mm are much less  abundant, and rarely cosmopolitan. The supporting data, together with the  discovery that the 1-10 mm size range accommodates a transition from cosmopolitan  to regionally-restricted distribution, were derived from extensive inventories of  eukaryotic species in a freshwater pond (1278 species), and a shallow marine bay  (785 species). All accessible records were examined to establish the extent of  global coverage by these species. Some groups of microbial eukaryotes are  severely undersampled (e.g. naked amoebae; marine meiofauna in the southern  hemisphere) but this fails to weaken evidence that metapopulations of microbial  eukaryotes are cosmopolitan.

SO The American naturalist
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB Commonness of organisms typically fluctuates through time, and understanding such  fluctuations has long been an important part of ecological research. Studies at  paleontological timescales provide a perspective on how changes in population  size might affect community structure over millions of years. To overcome the  obstacle that population size parameters such as abundance are difficult to  detect in the fossil record, we here used fossil locality coverage to approximate  changes in site occupancy in the Neogene of Europe over the course of 20 million  years. Our aim was to examine whether the trophic structure of mammalian  communities is maintained through time despite continuing environmental change.  Ecomorphological grouping of fossils indicates that herbivore genera have low  taxon resilience in that each genus has predominantly only one locality coverage  peak before disappearance. Despite this continuous replacement of the most  prevalent herbivore genera, the herbivore trophic group as a whole remains the  largest and maintains a roughly constant share of locality coverage throughout  the Neogene. The successive herbivore genera, however, show increasing  adaptations to harshening environments, indicating shifting properties of niches  while the overall trophic structure is conserved. Carnivores, dependent on  primary productivity for food indirectly through their prey, show moderate lack  of resilience. In contrast, in omnivores changes in locality coverage are close  to random fluctuations.

TI Rapid recovery from the Late Ordovician mass extinction.
SO Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB Understanding the evolutionary role of mass extinctions requires detailed  knowledge of postextinction recoveries. However, most models of recovery hinge on  a direct reading of the fossil record, and several recent studies have suggested  that the fossil record is especially incomplete for recovery intervals  immediately after mass extinctions. Here, we analyze a database of genus  occurrences for the paleocontinent of Laurentia to determine the effects of  regional processes on recovery and the effects of variations in preservation and  sampling intensity on perceived diversity trends and taxonomic rates during the  Late Ordovician mass extinction and Early Silurian recovery. After accounting for  variation in sampling intensity, we find that marine benthic diversity in  Laurentia recovered to preextinction levels within 5 million years, which is  nearly 15 million years sooner than suggested by global compilations. The rapid  turnover in Laurentia suggests that processes such as immigration may have been  particularly important in the recovery of regional ecosystems from environmental  perturbations. However, additional regional studies and a global analysis of the  Late Ordovician mass extinction that accounts for variations in sampling  intensity are necessary to confirm this pattern. Because the record of  Phanerozoic mass extinctions and postextinction recoveries may be compromised by  variations in preservation and sampling intensity, all should be reevaluated with  sampling-standardized analyses if the evolutionary role of mass extinctions is to  be fully understood.

TI Rapid recovery of genetic diversity of dogwhelk (Nucella lapillus L.) populations
SO Molecular ecology
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB The dogwhelk Nucella lapillus is a predatory marine gastropod populating North  Atlantic rocky shores. As with many other gastropod species, N. lapillus was  affected by tributyltin (TBT) pollution during the 1970s and 1980s, when local  populations became extinct. After a partial ban on TBT in the United Kingdom in  1987, vacant sites have been recolonized. N. lapillus lacks a planktonic larval  stage and is therefore expected to have limited dispersal ability. Relatively  fast recolonization of some sites, however, contradicts this assumption. We  compared levels of genetic diversity and genetic structuring between recolonized  sites and sites that showed continuous population at three localities across the  British Isles. No significant genetic effects of extinction/recolonization events  were observed in SW Scotland and NE England. In SW England we observed a decrease  in genetic diversity and an increase in genetic structure in recolonized  populations. This last result could be an artefact, however, due to the  superposition of other local factors influencing the genetic structuring of  dogwhelk populations. We conclude that recolonization of vacant sites was  accomplished by a relatively high number of individuals originating from several  source populations (the 'migrant-pool' model of recolonization), implying that  movements are more widespread than expected on the basis of development mode  alone. Comparison with published data on genetic structure of marine organisms  with contrasted larval dispersal supports this hypothesis. Our results also  stress the importance of local factors (geographical or ecological) in  determining genetic structure of dogwhelk populations.

TI Purity assessment of commercially available crystalline deoxynivalenol.
SO Journal of AOAC International
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB Deoxynivalenol (DON) obtained from 2 commercial sources was characterized, and  its purity was determined. The structural identity of DON was confirmed by 1H and  13C-nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, gas chromatography with mass  spectrometric (GC/MS) detection, and infrared/attenuated total reflectance  (IR/ATR) spectroscopy. NMR spectra showed shifts that varied from previously  published data. However, we established a complete, unambiguous assignment for  all signals. Chromatograms obtained by GC/MS were almost identical for both  investigated samples and confirmed the structure of DON. Likewise, IR/ATR spectra  verified the identity of DON. The degree of purity was determined by liquid  chromatography (LC) with a variable wavelength detector, LC/MS/MS, GC with  electron-capture detection (GC-ECD), and ultraviolet (UV) spectrophotometry. The  purity check using LC showed a single peak in both chromatograms. With LC/MS/MS  measurements, we could detect small amounts of impurities in the crystalline DON  from both sources. In data obtained by GC-ECD, no differences in purity were  observed. The UV measurements showed an absorption maximum at 217 nm. The mean  epsilon(m) of the extinction coefficients was calculated as 6727 (L/cm/mol) for  DON (Sigma) and 6825 (L/cm/mol) for DON (Biopure). Finally, the purity of DON  from the 2 commercial sources was calculated as >96 and >98%, respectively.  Although the DON produced by both providers can be considered sufficiently pure  for routine analysis of trichothecenes in food and feed, this work again  demonstrated that the impurity of the solid mycotoxin constitutes the greatest  contribution to the overall uncertainty of a mycotoxin calibrant.

TI The role of Quaternary environmental change in plant macroevolution: the
SO Philosophical transactions of the Royal Society of London. Series B, Biological
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB The Quaternary has been described as an important time for genetic  diversification and speciation. This is based on the premise that Quaternary  climatic conditions fostered the isolation of populations and, in some instances,  allopatric speciation. However, the 'Quaternary Ice-Age speciation model' rests  on two key assumptions: (i) that biotic responses to climate change during the  Quaternary were significantly different from those of other periods in Earth's  history; and (ii) that the mechanisms of isolation during the Quaternary were  sufficient in time and space for genetic diversification to foster speciation.  These assumptions are addressed by examining the plant fossil record for the  Quaternary (in detail) and for the past 410 Myr, which encompasses previous  intervals of icehouse Earth. Our examination of the Quaternary record indicates  that floristic responses to climate changes during the past 1.8 Myr were complex  and that a distinction has to be made between those plants that were able to  withstand the extremes of glacial conditions and those that could not. Generation  times are also important as are different growth forms (e.g. herbaceous annuals  and arborescent perennials), resulting in different responses in terms of genetic  divergence rates during isolation. Because of these variations in the duration of  isolation of populations and genomic diversification rates, no canonical  statement about the predominant floristic response to climatic changes during the  Quaternary (i.e. elevated rates of speciation or extinction, or stasis) is  currently possible. This is especially true because of a sampling bias in terms  of the fossil record of tree species over that of species with non-arborescent  growth forms. Nevertheless, based on the available information, it appears that  the dominant response of arborescent species during the Quaternary was extinction  rather than speciation or stasis. By contrast, our examination of the fossil  record of vascular plants for the past 410 Myr indicates that speciation rates  often increased during long intervals of icehouse Earth (spanning up to 50 Myr).  Therefore, longer periods of icehouse Earth than those occurring during the  Quaternary may have isolated plant populations for sufficiently long periods of  time to foster genomic diversification and allopatric speciation. Our results  highlight the need for more detailed study of the fossil record in terms of finer  temporal and spatial resolution than is currently available to examine the  significance of intervals of icehouse Earth. It is equally clear that additional  and detailed molecular studies of extant populations of Quaternary species are  required in order to determine the extent to which these 'relic' species have  genomically diversified across their current populations.

TI Edge vulnerability in neural and metabolic networks.
SO Biological cybernetics
LA English
DT Letter
AB Biological networks, such as cellular metabolic pathways or networks of  corticocortical connections in the brain, are intricately organized, yet  remarkably robust toward structural damage. Whereas many studies have  investigated specific aspects of robustness, such as molecular mechanisms of  repair, this article focuses more generally on how local structural features in  networks may give rise to their global stability. In many networks the failure of  single connections may be more likely than the extinction of entire nodes, yet no  analysis of edge importance (edge vulnerability) has been provided so far for  biological networks. We tested several measures for identifying vulnerable edges  and compared their prediction performance in biological and artificial networks.  Among the tested measures, edge frequency in all shortest paths of a network  yielded a particularly high correlation with vulnerability and identified  intercluster connections in biological but not in random and scale-free benchmark  networks. We discuss different local and global network patterns and the edge  vulnerability resulting from them.

TI Macroecological analyses support an overkill scenario for late Pleistocene
SO Brazilian journal of biology = Revista brasleira de biologia
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB The extinction of megafauna at the end of Pleistocene has been traditionally  explained by environmental changes or overexploitation by human hunting  (overkill). Despite difficulties in choosing between these alternative (and not  mutually exclusive) scenarios, the plausibility of the overkill hypothesis can be  established by ecological models of predator-prey interactions. In this paper, I  have developed a macroecological model for the overkill hypothesis, in which prey  population dynamic parameters, including abundance, geographic extent, and food  supply for hunters, were derived from empirical allometric relationships with  body mass. The last output correctly predicts the final destiny (survival or  extinction) for 73% of the species considered, a value only slightly smaller than  those obtained by more complex models based on detailed archaeological and  ecological data for each species. This illustrates the high selectivity of  Pleistocene extinction in relation to body mass and confers more plausibility on  the overkill scenario.

TI Demography in relation to population density in two herbivorous marsupials:
SO Oecologia
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB We compared demography of populations along gradients of population density in  two medium-sized herbivorous marsupials, the common brushtail possum Trichosurus  vulpecula and the rufous bettong Aepyprymnus rufescens, to test for net dispersal  from high density populations (acting as sources) to low density populations  (sinks). In both species, population density was positively related to soil  fertility, and variation in soil fertility produced large differences in  population density of contiguous populations. We predicted that if source-sink  dynamics were operating over this density gradient, we should find higher  immigration rates in low-density populations, and positive relationships of  measures of individual fitness--body condition, reproductive output, juvenile  growth rates and survivorship--to population density. This was predicted because  under source-sink dynamics, immigration from high-density sites would hold  population density above carrying capacity in low-density sites. The study  included 13 populations of these two species, representing a more than 50-fold  range of density for each species, but we found that individual fitness,  immigration rates and population turnover were similar in all populations. We  conclude that net dispersal from high to low density populations had little  influence on population dynamics in these species; rather, all populations  appeared to be independently regulated at carrying capacity, with a balanced  exchange of dispersers among populations. These two species have suffered recent  reductions in range, and they are ecologically similar to other species that have  declined to extinction in inland Australia. It has been argued that part of the  cause of the vulnerability of species like these is that they exhibit source-sink  dynamics, and disturbance to source habitats can therefore cause large-scale  population collapses. The results of our study argue against this interpretation.

AB In two experiments, the behavioral effects of different response-feedback  contingencies were examined with a task requiring human subjects to repeatedly  type three-key sequences on a computer keyboard. In Experiment 1, the subjects  first received positive feedback for response variability, followed by no  feedback, or vice versa In Experiment 2, the subjects first received positive  feedback for response variability, followed by response-independent positive  feedback, or vice versa. Response stability and variability were examined using  different measures, such as percentage of trials meeting the variability  criteria, frequency of use of the different response alternatives, and  autocorrelations as an index of response randomness. The subjects' behavior in  the first phase in each condition came to reflect the current feedback  contingency. Depending on the measure examined, responding after each contingency  change was characterized by both response stability and decreases or increases in  response variability. The collective results are discussed in the framework of  previous animal and human studies on behavioral stability and variability.

TI Expression, purification, and characterization of 3-deoxy-D-arabino-heptulosonate
SO Protein expression and purification
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB The enzyme 3-deoxy-D-arabino-heptulosonate 7-phosphate synthase (DAH7PS)  catalyzes the condensation reaction between phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) and  erythrose 4-phosphate (E4P). DAH7PS from the hyperthermophile Pyrococcus furiosus  has been expressed in Escherichia coli. The expressed protein was insoluble but  was partially solubilized as a dimer by the inclusion of 200 mM KCl in the cell  lysis buffer. An effective two step purification procedure has been developed.  The first step resulted in a high degree of purification and involved lysis by  sonication at approximately 40 degrees C followed by a heat treatment at 70  degrees C. A continuous assay measuring the loss of PEP at 232 nm at elevated  temperatures was also developed. Temperature, pH, and divalent metal ions all had  an effect on the extinction coefficient of PEP. Purified recombinant P. furiosus  DAH7PS is a dimer with a subunit Mr of 29,226 (determined by ESMS), shows  resistance to denaturation by SDS, has activity over a broad pH range, and has an  activation energy of 88 kJmol-1. The kinetic parameters are Km (PEP) 120 microM,  Km (E4P) 28 microM, and kcat 1.5s-1, at 60 degrees C and pH 6.8. DAH7PS is not  inhibited by phenylalanine, tyrosine, or tryptophan. EDTA inactivates the enzyme  and enzyme activity is restored by a wide range of divalent metal ions including  (in order of decreasing effectiveness): Zn2+, Cd2+, Mn2+, Co2+, Ni2+, Ca2+, Hg2+,  and Cu2+. This detailed characterization of the DAH7PS from P. furiosus raises  the possibility that the subfamily Ibeta DAH7PS enzymes are metal ion dependent,  contrary to previous predictions.

TI Cancer prevention strategies that address the evolutionary dynamics of neoplastic
SO Cancer epidemiology, biomarkers & prevention : a publication of the American
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB Cells in neoplasms evolve by natural selection. Traditional cytotoxic  chemotherapies add further selection pressure to the evolution of neoplastic  cells, thereby selecting for cells resistant to the therapies. An alternative  proposal is a benign cell booster. Rather than trying to kill the highly  dysplastic or malignant cells directly, a benign cell booster increases the  fitness of the more benign cells, which may be either normal or benign clones, so  that they may outcompete more advanced or malignant cells in a neoplasm. In  silico simulations of benign cell boosters in neoplasms with evolving clones show  benign cell boosters to be effective at destroying advanced or malignant cells  and preventing relapse even when applied late in progression. These results are  conditional on the benign cell boosters giving a competitive advantage to the  benign cells in the neoplasm. Furthermore, the benign cell boosters must be  applied over a long period of time in order for the benign cells to drive the  dysplastic cells to extinction or near extinction. Most importantly, benign cell  boosters based on this strategy must target a characteristic of the benign cells  that is causally related to the benign state to avoid relapse. Another promising  strategy is to boost cells that are sensitive to a cytotoxin, thereby selecting  for chemosensitive cells, and then apply the toxin. Effective therapeutic and  prevention strategies will have to alter the competitive dynamics of a neoplasm  to counter progression toward invasion, metastasis, and death.

TI Graphical analysis of mass and anisotropy changes observed by plasmon-waveguide
SO Biophysical journal
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB Plasmon-waveguide resonance spectroscopy is a recently developed optical method  that allows characterization of mass and structural changes in two-dimensionally  ordered thin films (e.g., proteolipid membranes) deposited onto a sensor surface.  Full analysis of these systems involves fitting theoretical curves (obtained  using Maxwell's equations) to experimental spectra measured using s- and  p-polarized excitation. This allows values to be obtained for refractive indices  and optical extinction coefficients in these two directions, as well as a value  for film thickness, thereby providing information about mass density and  anisotropy changes. This is a time-consuming process that works well for simple  systems in which only a single conformational event occurs, but cannot  distinguish between events involving multiple conformations that proceed either  sequentially or in a parallel series of events. This article describes a  graphical method that can distinguish between mass density and anisotropy changes  in a simpler, more rapid procedure, even for processes that proceed via multiple  conformational events. This involves measurement of plasmon-waveguide resonance  spectral shifts obtained upon molecular interactions occurring in deposited films  with both s- and p-polarized excitation, and transforming these from an (s-p)  coordinate system into a (mass-structure) coordinate system. This procedure is  illustrated by data obtained upon the binding of a small peptide, penetratin, to  solid-supported lipid bilayer membranes.

TI Influence of food availability on demography and local population dynamics in a
SO Proceedings. Biological sciences
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB Few studies have addressed the effects of food availability as a proximate factor  affecting local adult survival in long-lived organisms and their consequences at  local population dynamics. We used capture-recapture analysis of resightings of  10 birth cohorts of ringed Audouin's gulls, Larus audouinii, to estimate adult  survival and dispersal (both emigration and immigration). For the first time,  permanent emigration (the transient effect in capture-recapture analysis) was  modelled for the whole population and not only for the newly marked birds. Gulls  exploit to a large extent fishes discarded from trawlers, and a trawling  moratorium established since 1991 has decreased food supply for the colony. This  was used as a natural experiment of food availability to assess its effects on  adult survival and emigration. These and other demographic parameters were used  in a projection modelling to assess the probabilities of extinction of the colony  under two scenarios of lower and higher food availability. Food availability  (together with the age of individuals) influenced emigration probabilities, but  not adult survival, which was estimated at 0.91 (s.e. = 0.02). When food was in  shorter supply during the chick-rearing period, emigration was very high (ca.  65%) for younger breeders, although this rate decreased sharply with age.  Probabilities of extinction were very high when food availability was low, and  when environmental stochasticity was introduced, and only stochastic immigration  from the outside seemed to prevent extinction. The results highlight the  importance of dispersal processes in the population dynamics of long-lived  organisms.

TI Classical conditioning of sexual arousal in women and men: effects of varying
SO Archives of sexual behavior
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB Classical conditioning of sexual arousal has previously been demonstrated in  human males but not in females. This study explored the role of classical  (Pavlovian) conditioning in the activation of genital sexual arousal in both  women and men, and assessed the effects of varying conditioned stimulus (CS)  duration (subliminal/conscious) and relevance (sexually relevant/irrelevant).  Twenty-seven female and 29 male participants received either subliminal or  conscious presentations of a photograph of either a sexually relevant (abdomen of  the opposite sex) or irrelevant (gun) CS+, which was followed by the  unconditioned stimulus (US-erotic film clip). A CS-, a stimulus not paired with  the US, was also included in the 11 conditioning trials. Ten participants were  assigned to a control group that received unpaired presentations of the CS+, CS-,  and the US. Both women and men showed more evidence of conditioning to the  abdomen than to the gun when the CS was presented subliminally. When consciously  perceived CSs were used, however, gender differences emerged. Men again showed  the expected cue-to-consequence specificity but women showed the opposite effect,  that is, conditioned arousal to the sexually irrelevant rather than to the  relevant CS. The latter finding may be due to increased autonomic nervous system  arousal associated with the irrelevant CS (gun). Skin conductance responses  indicated more general arousal to the gun than to the male abdomen in women. This  is the first study to compare the effects of a subliminal and conscious CS and to  find classical conditioning of sexual arousal in women.

TI Biodiversity, distributions and adaptations of Arctic species in the context of
SO Ambio
LA English
DT Review
AB The individual of a species is the basic unit which responds to climate and UV-B  changes, and it responds over a wide range of time scales. The diversity of  animal, plant and microbial species appears to be low in the Arctic, and  decreases from the boreal forests to the polar deserts of the extreme North but  primitive species are particularly abundant. This latitudinal decline is  associated with an increase in super-dominant species that occupy a wide range of  habitats. Climate warming is expected to reduce the abundance and restrict the  ranges of such species and to affect species at their northern range boundaries  more than in the South: some Arctic animal and plant specialists could face  extinction. Species most likely to expand into tundra are boreal species that  currently exist as outlier populations in the Arctic. Many plant species have  characteristics that allow them to survive short snow-free growing seasons, low  solar angles, permafrost and low soil temperatures, low nutrient availability and  physical disturbance. Many of these characteristics are likely to limit species'  responses to climate warming, but mainly because of poor competitive ability  compared with potential immigrant species. Terrestrial Arctic animals possess  many adaptations that enable them to persist under a wide range of temperatures  in the Arctic. Many escape unfavorable weather and resource shortage by winter  dormancy or by migration. The biotic environment of Arctic animal species is  relatively simple with few enemies, competitors, diseases, parasites and  available food resources. Terrestrial Arctic animals are likely to be most  vulnerable to warmer and drier summers, climatic changes that interfere with  migration routes and staging areas, altered snow conditions and freeze-thaw  cycles in winter, climate-induced disruption of the seasonal timing of  reproduction and development, and influx of new competitors, predators, parasites  and diseases. Arctic microorganisms are also well adapted to the Arctic's  climate: some can metabolize at temperatures down to -39 degrees C. Cyanobacteria  and algae have a wide range of adaptive strategies that allow them to avoid, or  at least minimize UV injury. Microorganisms can tolerate most environmental  conditions and they have short generation times which can facilitate rapid  adaptation to new environments. In contrast, Arctic plant and animal species are  very likely to change their distributions rather than evolve significantly in  response to warming.

TI Patterns of resource use in early Homo and Paranthropus.
SO Journal of human evolution
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB Conventional wisdom concerning the extinction of Paranthropus suggests that these  species developed highly derived morphologies as a consequence of specializing on  a diet consisting of hard and/or low-quality food items. It goes on to suggest  that these species were so specialized or stenotopic that they were unable to  adapt to changing environments in the period following 1.5 Ma. The same  conventional wisdom proposes that early Homo species responded very differently  to the same environmental challenges. Instead of narrowing their niche it was the  dietary and behavioral flexibility (eurytopy) exhibited by early Homo that  enabled that lineage to persist. We investigate whether evidence taken across  eleven criteria supports a null hypothesis in which Paranthropus is more  stenotopic than early Homo. In six instances (most categories of direct evidence  of dietary breadth, species diversity, species duration, susceptibility to  dispersal, dispersal direction, and non-dietary adaptations) the evidence is  inconsistent with the hypothesis. Only one line of indirect evidence for dietary  breadth-occlusal morphology-is unambiguously consistent with the null hypothesis  that Paranthropus' ability to process tough, fibrous food items (e.g., leaves)  was reduced relative to early Homo. Other criteria (habitat preference,  population density, direct and indirect evidence of dietary breadth related to  incisor use) are only consistent with the hypothesis under certain conditions. If  those conditions are not met, then the evidence is either inconsistent with the  hypothesis, or ambiguous. On balance, Paranthropus and early Homo were both  likely to have been ecological generalists. These data are inconsistent with the  conventional wisdom that stenotopy was a major contributing factor in the  extinction of the Paranthropus clade. Researchers will need to explore other  avenues of research in order to generate testable hypotheses about the demise of  Paranthropus. Ecological models that may explain the evolution of eurytopy in  early hominins are discussed.

TI Tree dispersal strategies in the littoral forest of Sainte Luce (SE-Madagascar).
SO Oecologia
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB Zoochory is the most common mode of seed dispersal for the majority of plant  species in the tropics. Based on the assumption of tight plant-animal  interactions several hypotheses have been developed to investigate the origin of  life history traits of plant diaspores and their dispersers, such as  species-specific co-evolution, the low/high investment model (low investment in  single fruits but massive fruiting to attract many different frugivores versus  high investment in single fruits and fruit production for extended periods to  provide food for few frugivores), and the evolution of syndromes which represent  plant adaptations to disperser groups (e.g. birds, mammals, mixed). To test these  hypotheses the dispersal strategies of 34 tree species were determined in the  littoral forest of Sainte Luce (SE-Madagascar) with the help of fruit traps and  tree watches. The impact of fruit consumers on the seeds was determined based on  detailed behavioral observations. Phenological, morphological and biochemical  fruit traits from tree species were measured to look for co-variation with  different types of dispersal. No indication for species-specific co-evolution  could be found nor any support for the low/high investment model. However  dispersal syndromes could be distinguished as diaspores dispersed by birds,  mammals or both groups (mixed) differ in the size of their fruits and seeds,  fruit shape, and seed number, but not in biochemical traits. Five large-seeded  tree species seem to depend critically on the largest lemur, Eulemur fulvus  collaris, for seed dispersal. However, this does not represent a case of tight  species-specific co-evolution. Rather it seems to be the consequence of the  extinction of the larger frugivorous birds and lemurs which might also have fed  on these large fruits. Nevertheless these interactions are of crucial importance  to conserve the integrity of the forest.

TI Genetic consequences of climatic oscillations in the Quaternary.
SO Philosophical transactions of the Royal Society of London. Series B, Biological
LA English
DT Review
AB An appreciation of the scale and frequency of climatic oscillations in the past  few million years is modifying our views on how evolution proceeds. Such major  events caused extinction and repeated changes in the ranges of those taxa that  survived. Their spatial effects depend on latitude and topography, with extensive  extinction and recolonization in higher latitudes and altitudinal shifts and  complex refugia nearer the tropics. The associated population dynamics varied  with life history and geography, and the present genetic constitution of the  populations and species carry attenuated signals of these past dynamics.  Phylogeographic studies with DNA have burgeoned recently and studies are reviewed  from the arctic, temperate and tropical regions, seeking commonalities of cause  in the resulting genetic patterns. Arctic species show distinct shallow genetic  clades with common geographical boundaries. Thus Beringia is distinct  phylogeographically, but its role as a refugial source is complex. Arctic taxa do  not show the common genetic pattern of southern richness and northern purity in  north-temperate species. Temperate refugial regions in Europe and North America  show relatively deep DNA divergence for many taxa, indicating their presence over  several Ice Ages, and suggesting a mode of speciation by repeated allopatry. DNA  evidence indicates temperate species in Europe had different patterns of  postglacial colonization across the same area and different ones in previous  oscillations, whereas the northwest region of North America was colonized from  the north, east and south. Tropical montane regions contain deeply diverged  lineages, often in a relatively small geographical area, suggesting their  survival there from the Pliocene. Our poor understanding of refugial biodiversity  would benefit from further combined fossil and genetic studies.

TI Radiocarbon evidence of mid-Holocene mammoths stranded on an Alaskan Bering Sea
SO Nature
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB Island colonization and subsequent dwarfing of Pleistocene proboscideans is one  of the more dramatic evolutionary and ecological occurrences, especially in  situations where island populations survived end-Pleistocene extinctions whereas  those on the nearby mainland did not. For example, Holocene mammoths have been  dated from Wrangel Island in northern Russia. In most of these cases, few details  are available about the dynamics of how island colonization and extinction  occurred. As part of a large radiocarbon dating project of Alaskan mammoth  fossils, I addressed this question by including mammoth specimens from Bering Sea  islands known to have formed during the end-Pleistocene sea transgression. One  date of 7,908 +/- 100 yr bp (radiocarbon years before present) established the  presence of Holocene mammoths on St Paul Island, a first Holocene island record  for the Americas. Four lines of evidence--265 accelerator mass spectrometer (AMS)  radiocarbon dates from Alaskan mainland mammoths, 13 new dates from Alaskan  island mammoths, recent reconstructions of bathymetric plots and sea  transgression rates from the Bering Sea--made it possible to reconstruct how  mammoths became stranded in the Pribilofs and why this apparently did not happen  on other Alaskan Bering Sea islands.

TI Exclusive consolidated memory phases in Drosophila.

DT Journal Article
AB Two types of consolidated memory have been described in Drosophila,  anesthesia-resistant memory (ARM), a shorter-lived form, and stabilized long-term  memory (LTM). Until now, it has been thought that ARM and LTM coexist. On the  contrary, we show that LTM formation leads to the extinction of ARM. Flies devoid  of mushroom body vertical lobes cannot form LTM, but spaced conditioning can  still erase their ARM, resulting in a remarkable situation: The more these flies  are trained, the less they remember. We propose that ARM acts as a gating  mechanism that ensures that LTM is formed only after repetitive and spaced  training.

SO PLoS biology

DT Journal Article
AB Understanding why some species are at high risk of extinction, while others  remain relatively safe, is central to the development of a predictive  conservation science. Recent studies have shown that a species' extinction risk  may be determined by two types of factors: intrinsic biological traits and  exposure to external anthropogenic threats. However, little is known about the  relative and interacting effects of intrinsic and external variables on  extinction risk. Using phylogenetic comparative methods, we show that extinction  risk in the mammal order Carnivora is predicted more strongly by biology than  exposure to high-density human populations. However, biology interacts with human  population density to determine extinction risk: biological traits explain 80% of  variation in risk for carnivore species with high levels of exposure to human  populations, compared to 45% for carnivores generally. The results suggest that  biology will become a more critical determinant of risk as human populations  expand. We demonstrate how a model predicting extinction risk from biology can be  combined with projected human population density to identify species likely to  move most rapidly towards extinction by the year 2030. African viverrid species  are particularly likely to become threatened, even though most are currently  considered relatively safe. We suggest that a preemptive approach to species  conservation is needed to identify and protect species that may not be threatened  at present but may become so in the near future.

TI Sustainable trophy hunting of African lions.
SO Nature
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB In most species, sport hunting of male trophy animals can only reduce overall  population size when the rate of removal of males is so high that females can no  longer be impregnated. However, where males provide extensive paternal care, the  removal of even a few individuals could harm the population as a whole. In  species such as lions, excessive trophy hunting could theoretically cause male  replacements (and associated infanticide) to become sufficiently common to  prevent cubs reaching adulthood. Here we simulate the population consequences of  lion trophy hunting using a spatially explicit, individual-based, stochastic  model parameterized with 40 years of demographic data from northern Tanzania.  Although our simulations confirm that infanticide increases the risk of  population extinction, trophy hunting could be sustained simply by hunting males  above a minimum age threshold, and this strategy maximizes both the quantity and  the quality of the long-term kill. We present a simple non-invasive technique for  estimating lion age in populations lacking long-term records, and suggest that  quotas would be unnecessary in any male-only trophy species where age  determination could be reliably implemented.

TI The impact of cross-immunity, mutation and stochastic extinction on pathogen
SO Proceedings. Biological sciences
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB We examine the dynamics of antigenically diverse infectious agents using a  mathematical model describing the transmission dynamics of arbitrary numbers of  pathogen strains, interacting via cross-immunity, and in the presence of  mutations generating new strains and stochastic extinctions of existing ones.  Equilibrium dynamics fall into three classes depending on cross-immunity,  transmissibility and host population size: systems where global extinction is  likely, stable single-strain persistence, and multiple-strain persistence with  stable diversity. Where multi-strain dynamics are stable, a diversity threshold  region separates a low-prevalence, low-diversity region of parameter space from a  high-diversity, high-prevalence region. The location of the threshold region is  determined by the reproduction number of the pathogen and the intensity of  cross-immunity, with the sharpness of the transition being determined by the  manner in which immunity accrues with repeated infections. Host population size  and cross-immunity are found to be the most decisive factors in determining  pathogen diversity. While the model framework developed is simplified, we show  that it can capture essential aspects of the complex evolutionary dynamics of  pathogens such as influenza.

DT Journal Article
AB Temporally long-ranging (=long-lived) taxa have been postulated to have unusual  properties that aid their prolonged geologic survival. Past studies have examined  dispersal capabilities, geographic ranges, and single-character morphological  adaptations as factors that may contribute to geologic longevity. Here, I test  whether long-lived fossil crinoid taxa are morphologically unusual using a whole  suite of morphological characters. I define long-lived taxa in several explicit,  comparative ways. I find that long-lived crinoid genera and families are often  less distant from mean morphologies of their crinoid orders than their  shorter-lived relatives; that is, they are relatively less specialized. I also  compare the morphology of crinoid genera relative to basal members of their  respective orders; mean morphological distances of long-lived genera from basal  morphologies are seldom distinct from those of their shorter-lived relatives. I  observe that long-lived crinoid genera are less distant from mean morphologies of  their temporal cohorts compared with shorter-lived genera but not in a  statistically significant manner. I conclude that long-lived crinoids are  relatively unspecialized, in the sense that they are relatively closer to mean  morphologies of their taxonomic groups.

DT Journal Article
AB Springsnails of the genus Pyrgulopsis are the most diverse group of freshwater  gastropods in North America and current estimates show that Pyrgulopsis contains  ~120 different species, many of which are at risk of extinction. Some factors  contributing to their exceptional diversity include poor dispersal ability and  extreme habitat specificity based on water availability, chemistry and depth.  Most taxa exhibit high degrees of endemism, with many species occurring only in a  single spring or seep, making springsnails ideal for studies of speciation and  population structure. Here I present data from a survey of genetic variation at  the mitochondrial gene cytochrome oxidase I from 37 populations and over 1000  individuals belonging to 16 species of Pyrgulopsis distributed throughout the  lower Colorado River basin. High levels of interspecific sequence divergence  indicate that Pyrgulopsis may have colonized this region multiple times beginning  in the late Miocene (~6 Ma); earlier than previous estimates based on fossil  evidence. Estimates of nucleotide diversity differ greatly among species and may  reflect differences in demographic processes. These results are used to identify  factors contributing to radiation of species in this region. The implications of  this evolutionary history and genetic variation are discussed in relation to  future management and conservation.

TI Dynamic response of Permian brachiopod communities to long-term environmental
SO Nature
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB The fossil record preserves numerous natural experiments that can shed light on  the response of ecological communities to environmental change. However, directly  observing the community dynamics of extinct organisms is not possible. As an  alternative, neutral ecological models suggest that species abundance  distributions reflect dynamical processes like migration, competition,  recruitment, and extinction. Live-dead comparisons suggest that such  distributions can be faithfully preserved in the rock record. Here we use a  maximum-likelihood approach to show that brachiopod (lamp shell) abundance  distributions from four temporally distinct ecological landscapes from the Glass  Mountains, Texas (of the Permian period), exhibit significant differences.  Further, all four are better fitted by zero-sum multinomial distributions,  characteristic of Hubbell's neutral model, than by log-normal distributions, as  predicted by the traditional ecological null hypothesis. Using the neutral model  as a guide, we suggest that sea level fluctuations spanning about 10 Myr altered  the degrees of isolation and exchange among local communities within these  ecological landscapes. Neither these long-term environmental changes nor  higher-frequency sea level fluctuations resulted in wholesale extinction or major  innovation within evolutionary lineages.

TI Emergence of non-random structure in local food webs generated from randomly
SO Journal of theoretical biology
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB Previous studies have shown that high-resolution, empirical food webs possess a  non-random network structure, typically characterized by uniform or exponential  degree distributions. However, the empirical food webs that have been  investigated for their structural properties represent local communities that are  only a subset of a larger pool of regionally coexisting species. Here, we use a  simple model to investigate the effects of regional food web structure on local  food webs that are assembled by two simple processes: random immigration of  species from a source web (regional food web), and random extinction of species  within the local web. The model shows that local webs with non-random degree  distributions can arise from randomly structured source webs. A comparison of  local webs assembled from randomly structured source webs with local webs  assembled from source webs generated by the niche model shows that the former  have higher species richness at equilibrium, but have a nonlinear response to  changing extinction rates. These results imply that the network structure of  regional food webs can play a significant role in the assembly and dynamics of  local webs in natural ecosystems. With natural landscapes becoming increasingly  fragmented, understanding such structure may be a necessary key to understanding  the maintenance and stability of local species diversity.

TI Chicxulub impact predates the K-T boundary mass extinction.
SO Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB Since the early l990s the Chicxulub crater on Yucatan, Mexico, has been hailed as  the smoking gun that proves the hypothesis that an asteroid killed the dinosaurs  and caused the mass extinction of many other organisms at the Cretaceous-Tertiary  (K-T) boundary 65 million years ago. Here, we report evidence from a previously  uninvestigated core, Yaxcopoil-1, drilled within the Chicxulub crater, indicating  that this impact predated the K-T boundary by approximately 300,000 years and  thus did not cause the end-Cretaceous mass extinction as commonly believed. The  evidence supporting a pre-K-T age was obtained from Yaxcopoil-1 based on five  independent proxies, each with characteristic signals across the K-T transition:  sedimentology, biostratigraphy, magnetostratigraphy, stable isotopes, and  iridium. These data are consistent with earlier evidence for a late Maastrichtian  age of the microtektite deposits in northeastern Mexico.

AB Using a Monte Carlo approach we study the role of inheritance and natural  selection in the dynamics of populations. We show that a population subject to  inheritance has a much better chance of survival in a given condition than a  population where new generations do not inherit genomes of their parents. The  dependence of the survival chance on such factors as selection pressure,  fecundity, or carrying capacity of the system is much stronger when selection and  inheritance are present. We demonstrate, in accordance with biological  observations, that in certain conditions evolution can save a population which  would perish without it.

TI Selection, subdivision and extinction and recolonization.
SO Genetics
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB In a subdivided population, the interaction between natural selection and  stochastic change in allele frequency is affected by the occurrence of local  extinction and subsequent recolonization. The relative importance of selection  can be diminished by this additional source of stochastic change in allele  frequency. Results are presented for subdivided populations with extinction and  recolonization where there is more than one founding allele after extinction,  where these may tend to come from the same source deme, where the number of  founding alleles is variable or the founders make unequal contributions, and  where there is dominance for fitness or local frequency dependence. The behavior  of a selected allele in a subdivided population is in all these situations  approximately the same as that of an allele with different selection parameters  in an unstructured population with a different size. The magnitude of the  quantity N(e)s(e), which determines fixation probability in the case of genic  selection, is always decreased by extinction and recolonization, so that  deleterious alleles are more likely to fix and advantageous alleles less likely  to do so. The importance of dominance or frequency dependence is also altered by  extinction and recolonization. Computer simulations confirm that the theoretical  predictions of both fixation probabilities and mean times to fixation are good  approximations.

TI Avian extinction and mammalian introductions on oceanic islands.

DT Journal Article
AB The arrival of humans on oceanic islands has precipitated a wave of extinctions  among the islands' native birds. Nevertheless, the magnitude of this extinction  event varies markedly between avifaunas. We show that the probability that a bird  species has been extirpated from each of 220 oceanic islands is positively  correlated with the number of exotic predatory mammal species established on  those islands after European colonization and that the effect of these predators  is greater on island endemic species. In contrast, the proportions of currently  threatened species are independent of the numbers of exotic mammalian predator  species, suggesting that the principal threat to island birds has changed through  time as species susceptible to exotic predators have been driven extinct.

LA English
DT Journal Article
AB The sorption behavior of pyrene for different size fractions of colloidal organic  carbon (COC) originating from two biological wastewater treatment facilities (a  full-scale activated sludge system (FSAS) and a membrane bioreactor (MBR)) was  investigated by fluorescence quenching. Fluorescence lifetime measurements  demonstrated a dynamic quenching component in all samples, including the  colloidal-free filtrates. COC sorption coefficients (Kcoc) for pyrene ranged from  <1 x 10(3) L/kgcoc to 80 x 10(3) L/kgcoc and were comparable to values obtained  in the literature for natural organic matter. Both linear and nonlinear behaviors  were observed in the Freundlich-described converted isotherms (n = 0.89-2.1). The  aromatic content of COC was quantified by the molar extinction coefficient at 280  nm (e280). Good correlations were observed between COC-pyrene sorption  coefficients and e280 coefficients, suggesting that e280 may be a useful tool for  predicting colloidal transport of hydrophobic organic compounds (HOCs) from  activated sludge systems. The removal of COC from treated effluents may  appreciably reduce the concentrations of HOCs discharged to receiving streams.

TI Nestedness in colonization-dominated systems: helminth infracommunities of Rana
SO The Journal of parasitology
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB Colonization probabilities of parasite species often are determined by the  habitat preference and vagility of host individuals. Although extinction-based  interpretations have been investigated for nested subset patterns of parasite  infracommunities, the low relative frequency of nestedness in  colonization-dominated systems makes the determination and interpretation of  nested infracommunities of broad ecological importance. In these systems,  ontogenetic shifts in habitat preference or diet of the host have the potential  to produce nested subset patterns of parasite infracommunities. Helminth  infracommunity structure was investigated for 76 Rana vaillanti individuals  collected from Laguna Escondida, Los Tuxtlas, Veracruz, Mexico, in 1998. Pooled  helminth infracommunities were significantly nested, as were penetrating and  ingested helminth infracommunities when considered separately. Richness,  diversity, and evenness of the helminth infracommunities were not correlated with  host size, and did not differ between host sexes, suggesting that the structure  of infracommunities simply is a product of the interaction between host  individuals and their landscape mediated by individual differences in vagility.  It is hypothesized that individual differences in recruitment can produce nested  subset infracommunity patterns when the habitats or habitat preferences of hosts  are themselves nested.

AB Genotoxicity may be detected in surface waters by means of various genotoxicity  assays. In order to enable an ecotoxicological assessment of the consequences of  such genotoxic potential for fish populations, a complete life-cycle test with  zebrafish (Danio rerio) and the model genotoxicant 4-nitroquinoline-1-oxide (NQO)  was conducted. Zebrafish (f1) were continuously exposed to NQO (i.e. 0.1, 0.3,  1.1, 2.9, and 14.6 microg/l, respectively) from fertilised eggs until sexual  maturity. In addition to reproduction studies in the f1-generation, f2-fish were  exposed to NQO during the first 6 weeks of development. Up to 2.9 microg/l NQO,  fish did not display differences in survival and growth (P < 0.05). A NQO  concentration of 14.6 microg/l, however, was lethal. Female fish exposed to all  NQO concentrations up to 2.9 microg/l displayed a significant reduction in egg  production (P < 0.05). A mathematical simulation revealed that exposure to weak  concentrations of NQO is leading to an elevated extinction risk.

TI Competition and natural selection in a mathematical model of cancer.
SO Bulletin of mathematical biology
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB A malignant tumor is a dynamic amalgamation of various cell phenotypes, both  cancerous (parenchyma) and healthy (stroma). These diverse cells compete over  resources as well as cooperate to maintain tumor viability. Therefore, tumors are  both an ecological community and an integrated tissue. An understanding of how  natural selection operates in this unique ecological context should expose  unappreciated vulnerabilities shared by all cancers. In this study I address  natural selection's role in tumor evolution by developing and exploring a  mathematical model of a heterogenous primary neoplasm. The model is a system of  nonlinear ordinary differential equations tracking the mass of up to two  different parenchyma cell types, the mass of vascular endothelial cells from  which new tumor blood vessels are built and the total length of tumor  microvessels. Results predict the possibility of a hypertumor-a focus of  aggressively reproducing parenchyma cells that invade and destroy part or all of  the tumor, perhaps before it becomes a clinical entity. If this phenomenon  occurs, then we should see examples of tumors that develop an aggressive  histology but are paradoxically prone to extinction. Neuroblastoma, a common  childhood cancer, may sometimes fit this pattern. In addition, this model  suggests that parenchyma cell diversity can be maintained by a tissue-like  integration of cells specialized to provide different services.

TI Farming and the fate of wild nature.
SO Science (New York, N.Y.)
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB World food demand is expected to more than double by 2050. Decisions about how to  meet this challenge will have profound effects on wild species and habitats. We  show that farming is already the greatest extinction threat to birds (the best  known taxon), and its adverse impacts look set to increase, especially in  developing countries. Two competing solutions have been proposed:  wildlife-friendly farming (which boosts densities of wild populations on farmland  but may decrease agricultural yields) and land sparing (which minimizes demand  for farmland by increasing yield). We present a model that identifies how to  resolve the trade-off between these approaches. This shows that the best type of  farming for species persistence depends on the demand for agricultural products  and on how the population densities of different species on farmland change with  agricultural yield. Empirical data on such density-yield functions are sparse,  but evidence from a range of taxa in developing countries suggests that  high-yield farming may allow more species to persist.

SO Journal of the Air & Waste Management Association (1995)

DT Journal Article
AB Iron pentacarbonyl was added to a cocentric diffusion burner flame burning a  mixture of acetylene and ethylene in a co-flowing stream of air. Samples of  aerosols and gaseous species were collected within the flames and above the  flames with filters and a sampling bottle, and soot volume fraction through the  flame was calculated with laser light extinction measurements. Aerosol was  isokinetically collected in the inhalation chamber to measure particle  concentration and size distribution. Laser extinction measurement showed that  iron (Fe) gave an effect on soot formation process and scanning electron  microscopy of the aerosol sample showed that soot particle size for the Fe-doped  flame was relatively smaller than that of non-Fe-doped flame. Transmission  electron microscopy results indicated that Fe species were separated from the  soot at the downstream flame. Particles of the soot and Fe mixture could be  generated continuously, and the concentration was kept constant under a given  experimental condition using the cocentric diffusion flame burner. The mass  loading variation for each target concentration (i.e., 100, 200, and 400  microg/m3) in the inhalation chamber was less than +/-5% during 10 hr. This  particle-generating burner system could be used effectively for a bioassay test  to evaluate risk

SO Mathematical medicine and biology : a journal of the IMA

DT Journal Article
AB In this paper, we investigate a two-prey one-predator system with impulsive  effect on the predator of fixed moment. By using Floquet's theorem and  small-amplitude perturbation skills, we show that there exists a globally  asymptotically stable two-pest eradication periodic solution when the impulsive  period is less than some critical value. Further, we prove that the system is  permanent if the impulsive period is larger than some critical value, and  meanwhile the conditions for the extinction of one of the two prey and permanence  of the remaining two species are given. Finally, numerical simulation shows that  there exists a stable positive periodic solution with a maximum value no larger  than a given level. Therefore, we can use the stability of the positive periodic  solution and its period to control insect pests at acceptably low levels.

TI Sexual selection and the risk of extinction in mammals.
SO Proceedings. Biological sciences
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB Sexual selection is commonly envisaged as a force working in opposition to  natural selection, because extravagant or exaggerated traits could apparently  have never evolved via natural selection alone. There is good evidence that a  selection load imposed by sexual selection may be eased experimentally by  restricting the opportunity for it to operate. Sexual selection could therefore  potentially play an important role in influencing the risk of extinction that a  population faces, thereby contributing to the apparent selectivity of  extinctions. Conversely, recent theory predicts that the likelihood of extinction  may decrease when sexual selection is operating because it could accelerate the  rate of adaptation in concert with natural selection. So far, comparative  evidence (coming mostly from birds) has generally indicated support for the  former scenario, but the question remains open. The aim of this study was  therefore to examine whether the level of sexual selection (measured as residual  testes mass and sexual size dimorphism) was related to the risk of extinction  that mammals are currently experiencing. We found no evidence for a relationship  between these factors, although our analyses may have been confounded by the  possible dominating effect of contemporary anthropogenic factors.

TI Genetic variation increases during biological invasion by a Cuban lizard.
SO Nature
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB A genetic paradox exists in invasion biology: how do introduced populations,  whose genetic variation has probably been depleted by population bottlenecks,  persist and adapt to new conditions? Lessons from conservation genetics show that  reduced genetic variation due to genetic drift and founder effects limits the  ability of a population to adapt, and small population size increases the risk of  extinction. Nonetheless, many introduced species experiencing these same  conditions during initial introductions persist, expand their ranges, evolve  rapidly and become invasive. To address this issue, we studied the brown anole, a  worldwide invasive lizard. Genetic analyses indicate that at least eight  introductions have occurred in Florida from across this lizard's native range,  blending genetic variation from different geographic source populations and  producing populations that contain substantially more, not less, genetic  variation than native populations. Moreover, recently introduced brown anole  populations around the world originate from Florida, and some have maintained  these elevated levels of genetic variation. Here we show that one key to invasion  success may be the occurrence of multiple introductions that transform  among-population variation in native ranges to within-population variation in  introduced areas. Furthermore, these genetically variable populations may be  particularly potent sources for introductions elsewhere. The growing problem of  invasive species introductions brings considerable economic and biological costs.  If these costs are to be mitigated, a greater understanding of the causes,  progression and consequences of biological invasions is needed.

AB Rapid changes in biodiversity are occurring globally, yet the ecological impacts  of diversity loss are poorly understood. Here we use data from marine  invertebrate communities to parameterize models that predict how extinctions will  affect sediment bioturbation, a process vital to the persistence of aquatic  communities. We show that species extinction is generally expected to reduce  bioturbation, but the magnitude of reduction depends on how the functional traits  of individual species covary with their risk of extinction. As a result, the  particular cause of extinction and the order in which species are lost ultimately  govern the ecosystem-level consequences of biodiversity loss.

TI History and the species-area relationship in Lesser Antillean birds.
SO The American naturalist
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB We examined the species-area relationship for three historically distinct subsets  of Lesser Antillean birds identified by molecular phylogenetic analysis of island  and continental populations. The groups comprised recent colonists from  continental or Greater Antillean source populations, old taxa having recently  expanded distributions within the Lesser Antilles, and old endemic taxa lacking  evidence of recent dispersal between islands. The number of young taxa was  primarily related to distance from the source of colonists in South America. In a  multiple regression, the logarithmic slope of the species-area relationship for  this group was shallow (0.066+/-0.016). Old endemic taxa were restricted to  islands with high elevation, and within this subset, species richness was related  primarily to island area, with a steep slope (0.719+/-0.110). The number of  recently spread endemic taxa was related primarily to island elevation,  apparently reflecting the persistence of such populations on islands with large  areas of forested and montane habitats. Historical analysis of the Lesser  Antillean avifauna supports the dynamic concept of island biogeography of  MacArthur and Wilson, rather than the more static view of David Lack, in that  colonists exhibit dispersal limitation and extinction plays a role in shaping  patterns of diversity. However, the avifauna of the Lesser Antilles is probably  not in equilibrium at present, and the overall species-area relationship might  reflect changing proportions of historically distinguishable subsets of species.

TI Emergence of prime numbers as the result of evolutionary strategy.
SO Physical review letters
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB We investigate by means of a simple theoretical model the emergence of prime  numbers as life cycles, as those seen for some species of cicadas. The cicadas,  more precisely the Magicicadas, spend most of their lives below the ground and  then emerge and die in a short period of time. The Magicicadas display an  uncommon behavior: their emergence is synchronized and these periods are usually  prime numbers. In the current work, we develop a spatially extended model at  which preys and predators coexist and can change their evolutionary dynamics  through the occurrence of mutations. We verified that prime numbers as life  cycles emerge as a result of the evolution of the population. Our results seem to  be a first step in order to prove that the development of such strategy is  selectively advantageous, especially for those organisms that are highly  vulnerable to attacks of predators.

TI Ecosystem consequences of bird declines.

DT Journal Article
AB We present a general framework for characterizing the ecological and societal  consequences of biodiversity loss and applying it to the global avifauna. To  investigate the potential ecological consequences of avian declines, we developed  comprehensive databases of the status and functional roles of birds and a  stochastic model for forecasting change. Overall, 21% of bird species are  currently extinction-prone and 6.5% are functionally extinct, contributing  negligibly to ecosystem processes. We show that a quarter or more of frugivorous  and omnivorous species and one-third or more of herbivorous, piscivorous, and  scavenger species are extinction-prone. Furthermore, our projections indicate  that by 2100, 6-14% of all bird species will be extinct, and 7-25% (28-56% on  oceanic islands) will be functionally extinct. Important ecosystem processes,  particularly decomposition, pollination, and seed dispersal, will likely decline  as a result.

SO Environmental science & technology
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB Sorption coefficients (K(COC)) between 17beta-estradiol (E2),  17alpha-ethinylestradiol (EE2) and size-fractionated colloidal organic carbon  (COC) derived from two biological wastewater treatment facilities were quantified  by fluorescence quenching. The two wastewater treatment systems included a  full-scale activated sludge system (FSAS) and a membrane bioreactor (MBR). The  K(COC) coefficients were highly variable and ranged between (<1 to 179) x 10(3)  L/kgCOC for E2 and (<1 to 430) x 10(3) L/kgCOC for EE2 and were higher than  expected from the analytes octanol-water partition coefficient. Correlations  between the molar extinction coefficients measured at 280 nm (e280) and K(COC)  coefficients were weak but stronger for E2 compared to EE2. Attempts at  correlating sorption behavior with colloidal protein and polysaccharide  concentrations were only marginally successful (r2 approximately 0.4). These low  correlations suggest that aromatic content, protein, or polysaccharide  concentration can not adequately explain E2 and EE2 sorption behavior to COC and  that other fractions of the organic matter pool play an important role in  binding. A substantial portion of the aqueous E2 and EE2 concentrations (up to  60%) may be associated with colloidal material, suggesting that COC may play a  role in the fate and transport of E2 and EE2 during the activated sludge process.

SO Genetics and molecular research : GMR
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB Our theory is embarrassingly simple. What made today's prokaryotes and modern  cyanobacteria so robust is the fact that in their origin, back in the Archean (3  billion years ago), selection did not play a central role in evolution, it had  only a transitory role. Asexual reproduction, mutation, drift and sampling  variance in local demes were more important especially when they were accompanied  by population catastrophes, where millions perished. Metazoans are generally  macroscopic, sexually reproducing, ecologically specialized organisms whose  history is full of extinctions and radiations leading to morphological change. On  the other hand, prokaryotes, thanks to their origin, avoid extinction because as  a group they have slowly evolved as generalists. Specialization appears to be  less important than ecological versatility and metabolic unspecialization. Modern  cyanobacteria keep on using that strategy.

TI Allee effects and the risk of biological invasion.
SO Risk analysis : an official publication of the Society for Risk Analysis
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB The Allee effect is a nonlinear phenomenon exhibited in the population dynamics  of sparse populations in which the per capita population growth rate increases  with increasing population density. In sufficiently sparse populations, the Allee  effect may lead to extinction and is known to generate a threshold in the  probability of establishment when presented as a function of introduced  population size or density. As introduced populations are generally small, Allee  effects are probably common in biological invasions and their consideration is  necessary for accurately assessing the risk of invasion by many species,  including all sexually reproducing species. Bythotrephes longimanus, an invasive,  freshwater, cladoceran zooplankter from Europe, is one such species. Here, I  review a previously published model of the Allee effect for continuously sexually  reproducing species. Then, I develop a new model for seasonally parthenogenetic  species such as Bythotrephes, and thereby demonstrate the potential consequences  of Allee effects. This result underscores the importance of considering nonlinear  phenomena, including thresholds, when conducting risk analysis for biological  introductions.

TI The tobacco mouse and its relatives: a "tail" of coat colors, chromosomes,
SO Cytogenetic and genome research
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB The article reviews over 30 years' study of the chromosomal variation of the  western house mice (Mus musculus domesticus) from the neighboring valleys of  Poschiavo and Valtellina on the Swiss-Italian border. This is done in the context  of the social and political history of this area, on the grounds that mice, as  commensals, are influenced by human history. The chromosomal study of mice in  this area was initiated because their unusual black coat color led a 19th century  naturalist to describe the "tobacco mice" from Val Poschiavo as a separate  species (Mus poschiavinus). The special coloration of the Val Poschiavo mice is  matched by their chromosomes: they have 26 chromosomes instead of the usual 40.  The Val Poschiavo mice are not a separate species according to the Biological  Species Concept; instead they constitute a chromosome race (the "Poschiavo", POS)  that is related to other races with reduced chromosome numbers that occur in N  Italy (of which only those races in Val Poschiavo and Upper Valtellina have black  coats). A phylogenetic analysis of mitochondrial DNA sequences suggests that the  lineage of chromosome races found in N Italy was not formed during an extreme  population bottleneck, although such bottlenecks have apparently occurred during  the origin of individual races and certainly have influenced single populations.  In one small, isolated population in Valtellina (Migiondo), two chromosome races  (the POS and the "Upper Valtellina", UV, 2n = 24) became reproductively isolated  from each other. In another small population (Sernio) bottlenecking led to  fixation of a hybrid form with the UV karyotype and coat color, but with allozyme  and microsatellite alleles characteristic of mice with the standard 40-chromosome  karyotype. Two of the chromosome races in Valtellina (the UV and the "Mid  Valtellina", MV, 2n = 24) also appear to be the product of hybridization. The  dynamic history and patchy distribution of the house mouse chromosome races in  Val Poschiavo and Valtellina in part reflects extinction-recolonization events;  the formation of the UV and MV races and the introduction of the pale brown  Standard race mice are believed to reflect such events. Dynamism in the  chromosomal constitution of single populations is also evident from 25 years of  data on the population in Migiondo. Due to change in agricultural practices,  house mice in Valtellina and Val Poschiavo are becoming rarer, which is likely to  have further impacts on the distribution and characteristics of the chromosome  races in this area.

TI Mesolimbic dopaminergic pathways in fear conditioning.
SO Progress in neurobiology
LA English
DT Review
AB One of the most common paradigms used to study the biological basis of emotion,  as well as of learning and memory, is Pavlovian fear conditioning. In the  acquisition phase of a fear conditioning experiment, an emotionally neutral  conditioned stimulus (CS)--which can either be a discrete stimulus, such as a  tone, or a contextual stimulus, such as a specific environment--is paired with an  aversive unconditioned stimulus (US), for example a foot shock. As a result, the  CS elicits conditioned fear responses when subsequently presented alone during  the expression phase of the experiment. While considerable work has been done in  relating specific circuits of the brain to fear conditioning, less is known about  its regulation by neuromodulators; the understanding of which would be of  therapeutic relevance for fear related diseases such as phobia, panic attacks,  post traumatic stress disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder, or generalized  anxiety disorder. Dopamine is one of the neuromodulators most potently acting on  the mechanisms underlying states of fear and anxiety. Recently, a growing body of  evidence has suggested that dopaminergic mechanisms are significant for different  aspects of affective memory, namely its formation, expression, retrieval, and  extinction. The aim of this review is to clarify the complex actions of dopamine  in fear conditioning with respect to the wide-spread distribution of dopaminergic  innervation over structures constituting the fear related circuitry. A particular  effort is made to understand how dopamine in the amygdala, medial prefrontal  cortex and nucleus accumbens--target structures of the mesolimbic dopamine system  originating from the ventral tegmental area--could relate to different aspects of  fear conditioning.

DT Journal Article
AB We conducted a series of spectral extinction measurements on a variety of  aerosolized chemical and biological simulants over the spectral range 3-13 microm  using conventional Fourier-transform IR (FTIR) aerosol spectroscopy. Samples  consist of both aerosolized particulates and atomized liquids. Materials  considered include Bacillus subtilis endospores, lyophilized ovalbumin,  polyethylene glycol, dimethicone (SF-96), and three common background materials:  kaolin clay (hydrated aluminum silicate), Arizona road dust (primarily SiO2), and  diesel soot. Aerosol size distributions and mass density were measured  simultaneously with the FTIR spectra. As a result, all optical parameters  presented here are mass normalized, i.e., in square meters per gram. In an effort  to establish the utility of using Mie theory to predict such parameters, we  conducted a series of calculations. For materials in which the complex indices of  refraction are known, e.g., silicone oil (SF-96) and kaolin, measured size  distributions were convolved with Mie theory and the resultant spectral  extinction calculated. Where there was good agreement between measured and  calculated extinction spectra, absorption, total scattering, and backscatter were  also calculated.

AB We study a model of a multispecies ecosystem described by Lotka-Volterra-like  equations. Interactions among species form a network whose evolution is  determined by the dynamics of the model. Numerical simulations show power-law  distribution of intervals between extinctions, but only for ecosystems with  sufficient variability of species and with networks of connectivity above certain  threshold that is very close to the percolation threshold of the network. The  effect of slow environmental changes on extinction dynamics, degree distribution  of the network of interspecies interactions, and some emergent properties of our  model are also examined.

TI Computing prokaryotic gene ubiquity: rescuing the core from extinction.
SO Genome research
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB The genomic core concept has found several uses in comparative and evolutionary  genomics. Defined as the set of all genes common to (ubiquitous among) all  genomes in a phylogenetically coherent group, core size decreases as the number  and phylogenetic diversity of the relevant group increases. Here, we focus on  methods for defining the size and composition of the core of all genes shared by  sequenced genomes of prokaryotes (Bacteria and Archaea). There are few (almost  certainly less than 50) genes shared by all of the 147 genomes compared, surely  insufficient to conduct all essential functions. Sequencing and annotation errors  are responsible for the apparent absence of some genes, while very limited but  genuine disappearances (from just one or a few genomes) can account for several  others. Core size will continue to decrease as more genome sequences appear,  unless the requirement for ubiquity is relaxed. Such relaxation seems consistent  with any reasonable biological purpose for seeking a core, but it renders the  problem of definition more problematic. We propose an alternative approach (the  phylogenetically balanced core), which preserves some of the biological utility  of the core concept. Cores, however delimited, preferentially contain  informational rather than operational genes; we present a new hypothesis for why  this might be so.

AB Aim  This paper reports the diversity and endemism patterns of African ferns, and  explores the potential role of diversity refuges and environmental and historical  factors in the shaping of these patterns. Material and locations  The extant fern  taxa occupying Africa south of the Sahara, Madagascar and some islands of the  South Atlantic. Methods  The number of taxa in each area or operational  geographical unit (OGU) was scored, and the correlation between this number and  physical and climatic variables analysed by standard pairwise and stepwise  multiple regression analysis (SPR and SMR). The effects of biological factors  such as dispersal capacity, reproductive biology, genetic features and certain  physiological adaptations were evaluated by comparing the number of species in  each OGU. Floral affinities among OGUs were analysed using non-metric  multi-dimensional scaling (NMS) and parsimonic analysis of dispersion (PAD), and  compared with β-turnover and inter-OGU distances. Results  OGU area, elevation  and the distance between refuges determined the composition of local floras, but  only greater OGU area and the existence of higher maximum elevations increased  species richness. The distance between refuges also affected the number of  endemic species, especially on islands. The biological features studied only  slightly influenced fern distribution. The main climatic predictor of species  number was humidity. SPR and SMR revealed three main groups of ferns with  different ecological trends. NMS and PAD analyses separated the four areas of  highest diversity in Africa, three of which are inhabited by ferns with distinct  ecological requirements. The fourth area was Madagascar, which shows an  accumulation of endemic and relict diversity that is not easy to explain. Main  conclusions  The distribution of ferns in Africa has been influenced by refuges.  These probably allowed many species to recolonize the neighbouring areas after  the extinctions of the Pleistocene. Three major components were detected in the  African flora: Guinea-Congolian thermophilous, cold-tolerant Afro-montane, and  Southern drought-tolerant elements. These are related to the three main refuge  areas, i.e. the Gulf of Guinea area, the eastern tropical region, and the Cape  region. Endemicity in ferns was found to be lower than that of seed plants due to  the higher dispersability of fern spores. The distance between OGUs seems to be  the main predictor of the number of endemic fern species these areas contain.

TI Characterization of visibility impacts related to fine particulate matter in
SO Journal of the Air & Waste Management Association (1995)
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB Canada has recently established standards for the management of particulate  matter (PM) air quality. National networks currently measure PM mass  concentrations and chemical speciation. Methods used in the U.S. IMPROVE network  are applied to the 1994--2000 Canadian fine PM data to obtain a regional  reconstruction of the visibility based on particle composition. Nationally, the  greatest light extinction occurs in the Windsor-Quebec City corridor. Variations  in the dominant chemical species responsible for the reduction in visibility are  presented for regions across the country. In most regions, sulfate and nitrate  contribute most greatly to reduced visibility. The visibility implications of  achieving the Canada-Wide Standard (CWS) across the country are evaluated, with  the greatest improvement in visibility associated with achieving the CWS in  southern Ontario. Elsewhere in the country, achieving the CWS will actually  result in deteriorating air quality. Improving current estimates of visibility  requires higher spatially and temporally resolved measurements of organic and  elemental carbon fractions and particulate nitrate.

TI Synchrony & chaos in patchy ecosystems.
SO Bulletin of mathematical biology
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB The apparent synchronisation of spatially discrete populations is a well  documented phenomenon. However, it is not clear what the governing mechanisms are  for this synchrony, and whether they are robust over a range of environmental  conditions and patch specific population dynamic behaviours. In this paper, we  explore two (possibly interacting) modes of coupling, and investigate their  theoretically discernible, and perhaps even experimentally measurable,  signatures. To aid us in this investigation we employ a planktonic example  system, with direct application to plankton patchiness. Furthermore, we address  the role of chaos in complex spatio-temporal dynamics; we find that chaos  associated with funnel attractors can play a distinguished role, over dynamics  less sensitive to small variations, in being more susceptible to generalised  synchronisation (such as phase synchronisation) in the presence of small local  parameter variation. This is in contrast to the case for coupled systems with  identical dynamics, and suggests that non-identically coupled systems are more  vulnerable to global extinction events when exhibiting funnel-type chaotic  dynamics.

DT Journal Article
AB In this article, we explore the large-scale structure of the tree of life by  using a simple model with a constant number of species and rates of speciation  that equal the rates of extinction. In addition, we discuss the consequences of  horizontal gene transfer for the concept of a most recent common ancestor of all  living organisms (cenancestor). A simple null hypothesis based on coalescence  theory explains some features of the observed topologies of the tree of life.  Simulations of genes and organismal lineages suggest that there was no single  common ancestor that contained all the genes ancestral to those shared among the  three domains of life. Each contemporary molecule has its own history that traces  back to an individual molecular cenancestor. However, these molecular ancestors  were likely to be present in different organisms and at different times.

TI Transgenic male mating advantage provides opportunity for Trojan gene effect in a
SO Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB Genetically modified (GM) strains now exist for many organisms, producing  significant promise for agricultural production. However, if these organisms have  some fitness advantage, they may also pose an environmental harm when released.  High mating success of GM males relative to WT males provides such an important  fitness advantage. Here, we provide documentation that GM male medaka fish  modified with salmon growth hormone possess an overwhelming mating advantage. GM  medaka offspring possess a survival disadvantage relative to WT, however. When  both of these fitness components are included in our model, the transgene is  predicted to spread if GM individuals enter wild populations (because of the  mating advantage) and ultimately lead to population extinction (because of the  viability disadvantage). Mating trials indicate that WT males use alternative  mating tactics in an effort to counter the mating advantage of GM males, and we  use genetic markers to ascertain the success of these alternative strategies.  Finally, we model the impact of alternative mating tactics by WT males on  transgene spread. Such tactics may reduce the rate of transgene spread, but not  the outcome.

The unusual behavior of the carbon cycle  coincides with the delayed recovery from end-Permian extinction recorded by  fossils, suggesting a direct relationship between Earth system function and  biological rediversification in the aftermath of Earth's most devastating mass  extinction.

TI A field test for competitive effects of Aedes albopictus on A. aegypti in South
SO Oecologia
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB We tested whether interspecific competition from Aedes albopictus had measurable  effects on A. aegypti at the typical numbers of larval mosquitoes found in  cemetery vases in south Florida. We also tested whether the effect of  interspecific competition from A. albopictus on A. aegypti differed between sites  where A. aegypti either persists or went extinct following invasion by A.  albopictus. Similar experiments manipulating numbers of A. albopictus in cemetery  vases were conducted at three sites of A. aegypti persistence and three sites  where A. aegypti was apparently extinct. The experiments were done using numbers  of larvae that were determined by observed numbers of larvae for each site, and  with resources (leaf detritus) that accumulated in experimental vases placed into  each field site. In both the early rainy season (when number of mosquito larvae  was low) and the late rainy season (when number of mosquito larvae was high),  there was a significant effect of treatment on developmental progress of  experimental A. aegypti. In the late rainy season, when numbers of larvae were  high, there was also a significant effect of treatment on survivorship of A.  aegypti. However, the competition treatment x site type (A. aegyptipersists vs  extinct) interaction was never significant, indicating that the competitive  effect of A. albopictus on A. aegypti did not differ systematically between  persistence versus extinction sites. Thus, although competition from A.  albopictus is strong under field conditions at all sites, we find no evidence  that variation in the impact of interspecific competition is associated with  coexistence or exclusion. Interspecific competition among larvae is thus a viable  explanation for exclusion or reduction of A. aegypti in south Florida, but  variation in the persistence of A. aegypti following invasion does not seem to be  primarily a product of variation in the conditions in the aquatic environments of  cemetery vases.

TI Extinction in population dynamics.
SO Physical review. E, Statistical, nonlinear, and soft matter physics
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB We study a generic reaction-diffusion model for single-species population  dynamics that includes reproduction, death, and competition. The population is  assumed to be confined in a refuge beyond which conditions are so harsh that they  lead to certain extinction. Standard continuum mean field models in one dimension  yield a critical refuge length L(c) such that a population in a refuge larger  than this is assured survival. Herein we extend the model to take into account  the discreteness and finiteness of the population, which leads us to a stochastic  description. We present a particular critical criterion for likely extinction,  namely, that the standard deviation of the population be equal to the mean.  According to this criterion, we find that while survival can no longer be  guaranteed for any refuge size, for sufficiently weak competition one can make  the refuge large enough (certainly larger than L(c)) to cause extinction to be  unlikely. However, beyond a certain value of the competition rate parameter it is  no longer possible to escape a likelihood of extinction even in an infinite  refuge. These unavoidable fluctuations therefore have a severe impact on refuge  design issues.

TI Age and timing of the Permian mass extinctions: U/Pb dating of closed-system
SO Science (New York, N.Y.)
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB The age and timing of the Permian-Triassic mass extinction have been difficult to  determine because zircon populations from the type sections are typically  affected by pervasive lead loss and contamination by indistinguishable older  xenocrysts. Zircons from nine ash beds within the Shangsi and Meishan sections  (China), pretreated by annealing followed by partial attack with hydrofluoric  acid, result in suites of consistent and concordant uranium/lead (U/Pb) ages,  eliminating the effects of lead loss. The U/Pb age of the main pulse of the  extinction is 252.6 +/- 0.2 million years, synchronous with the Siberian flood  volcanism, and it occurred within the quoted uncertainty.

TI Rapid population decline in red knots: fitness consequences of decreased
SO Proceedings. Biological sciences
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB Most populations of migrant shorebirds around the world are in serious decline,  suggesting that vital condition-dependent rates such as fecundity and annual  survival are being affected globally. A striking example is the red knot  (Calidris canutus rufa) population wintering in Tierra del Fuego, which  undertakes marathon 30,000 km hemispheric migrations annually. In spring, migrant  birds forage voraciously on horseshoe crab eggs in Delaware Bay in the eastern  USA before departing to breed in Arctic polar deserts. From 1997 to 2002 an  increasing proportion of knots failed to reach threshold departure masses of  180-200 g, possibly because of later arrival in the Bay and food shortage from  concurrent over-harvesting of crabs. Reduced nutrient storage, especially in  late-arriving birds, possibly combined with reduced sizes of intestine and liver  during refuelling, had severe fitness consequences for adult survival and  recruitment of young in 2000-2002. From 1997 to 2002 known survivors in Delaware  Bay were heavier at initial capture than birds never seen again, annual survival  of adults decreased by 37% between May 2000 and May 2001, and the number of  second-year birds in wintering flocks declined by 47%. Population size in Tierra  del Fuego declined alarmingly from 51,000 to 27,000 in 2000-2002, seriously  threatening the viability of this subspecies. Demographic modelling predicts  imminent endangerment and an increased risk of extinction of the subspecies  without urgent risk-averse management.

TI Cope's rule, hypercarnivory, and extinction in North American canids.
SO Science (New York, N.Y.)
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB Over the past 50 million years, successive clades of large carnivorous mammals  diversified and then declined to extinction. In most instances, the cause of the  decline remains a puzzle. Here we argue that energetic constraints and pervasive  selection for larger size (Cope's rule) in carnivores lead to dietary  specialization (hypercarnivory) and increased vulnerability to extinction. In two  major clades of extinct North American canids, the evolution of large size was  associated with a dietary shift to hypercarnivory and a decline in species  durations. Thus, selection for attributes that promoted individual success  resulted in progressive evolutionary failure of their clades.

TI Biogeography explains cophylogenetic patterns in toucan chewing lice.
SO Systematic biology
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB Historically, comparisons of host and parasite phylogenies have concentrated on  cospeciation. However, many of these comparisons have demonstrated that the  phylogenies of hosts and parasites are seldom completely congruent, suggesting  that phenomena other than cospeciation play an important role in the evolution of  host-parasite assemblages. Other coevolutionary phenomena, such as host  switching, parasite duplication (speciation on the host), sorting (extinction),  and failure to speciate can also influence host-parasite assemblages. Using  mitochondrial and nuclear protein-coding DNA sequences, I reconstructed the  phylogeny of ectoparasitic toucan chewing lice in the Austrophilopterus  cancellosus subspecies complex and compared this phylogeny with the phylogeny of  the hosts, the Ramphastos toucans, to reconstruct the history of coevolutionary  events in this host-parasite assemblage. Three salient findings emerged. First,  reconstructions of host and louse phylogenies indicate that they do not branch in  parallel, and their cophylogenetic history shows little or no significant  cospeciation. Second, members of monophyletic Austrophilopterus toucan louse  lineages are not necessarily restricted to monophyletic host lineages. Often,  closely related lice are found on more distantly related but sympatric toucan  hosts. Third, the geographic distribution of the hosts apparently plays a role in  the speciation of these lice. These results suggest that for some louse lineages  biogeography may be more important than host associations in structuring louse  populations and species, particularly when host life history (e.g., hole nesting)  or parasite life history (e.g., phoresis) might promote frequent host switching  events between syntopic host species. These findings highlight the importance of  integrating biogeographic information into cophylogenetic studies.

TI Mangroves enhance the biomass of coral reef fish communities in the Caribbean.
SO Nature
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB Mangrove forests are one of the world's most threatened tropical ecosystems with  global loss exceeding 35% (ref. 1). Juvenile coral reef fish often inhabit  mangroves, but the importance of these nurseries to reef fish population dynamics  has not been quantified. Indeed, mangroves might be expected to have negligible  influence on reef fish communities: juvenile fish can inhabit alternative  habitats and fish populations may be regulated by other limiting factors such as  larval supply or fishing. Here we show that mangroves are unexpectedly important,  serving as an intermediate nursery habitat that may increase the survivorship of  young fish. Mangroves in the Caribbean strongly influence the community structure  of fish on neighbouring coral reefs. In addition, the biomass of several  commercially important species is more than doubled when adult habitat is  connected to mangroves. The largest herbivorous fish in the Atlantic, Scarus  guacamaia, has a functional dependency on mangroves and has suffered local  extinction after mangrove removal. Current rates of mangrove deforestation are  likely to have severe deleterious consequences for the ecosystem function,  fisheries productivity and resilience of reefs. Conservation efforts should  protect connected corridors of mangroves, seagrass beds and coral reefs.

TI A continuous spectrophotometric assay for NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase
SO Journal of biochemistry and molecular biology
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase (CPR) transfers electrons from NADPH to  cytochrome P450, and catalyzes the one-electron reduction of many drugs and  foreign compounds. Various forms of spectrophotometric titration have been  performed to investigate the electron-accepting properties of CPR, particularly,  to examine its ability to reduce cytochrome c and ferricyanide. In this study,  the reduction of 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) by CPR was assessed as a  means of monitoring CPR activity. The principle advantage of DPPH is that its  reduction can be assayed directly in the reaction medium by a continuous  spectrophotometry. Thus, electrons released from NADPH by CPR were transferred to  DPPH, and DPPH reduction was then followed spectrophotometrically by measuring  A(520) reduction. Optimal assay concentrations of DPPH, CPR, potassium phosphate  buffer, and NADPH were first established. DPPH reduction activity was found to  depend upon the strength of the buffer used, which was optimal at 100 mM  potassium phosphate and pH 7.6. The extinction coefficient of DPPH was 4.09mM(-1)  cm(-1). DPPH reduction followed classical Michaelis-Menten kinetics (K(m) = 28  microM, k(cat) = 1690 min(-1)). This method uses readily available materials, and  has the additional advantages of being rapid and inexpensive.

TI Host-parasitoid extinction and colonization in a fragmented prairie landscape.
SO Oecologia
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB Few field studies of natural populations have examined the factors influencing  local extinctions and colonization of empty habitat patches for a prey species  and its predator. In this study, I carried out a census of planthopper  (Prokelisia crocea; Hemiptera: Delphacidae) and egg parasitoid (Anagrus columbi;  Hymenoptera: Mymaridae) incidence and densities in 147 host-plant patches  (Spartina pectinata; Poaceae) over seven planthopper generations in a tall-grass  prairie landscape. For both species, the likelihood of going extinct in a patch  was related to a number of patch-specific variables: density, temporal  variability in density, proportion of hosts parasitized (planthopper only),  host-plant density, patch size, patch isolation, and composition of the  surrounding matrix. Colonization likelihood was related only to the physical  attributes of the patch. There was high patch turnover in this prairie landscape.  On average, planthoppers went extinct in 23% of the patches and A. columbi went  extinct in 51% of the patches in each generation. For the planthopper, extinction  likelihood increased with a decrease in patch size and the proportion of the  matrix composed of mudflat. Parasitism of eggs had no effect on the extinction  likelihood of local P. crocea populations, suggesting that A. columbi may not  play a major role in the patch dynamics of its host. The likelihood of extinction  for A. columbi was dependent on factors that spanned three trophic levels. An  increase in plant density, decrease in host density and decrease in parasitoid  density all increased the likelihood of A. columbi extinction within a patch. The  dependency on multiple trophic levels may explain the higher extinction risk for  the parasitoid than its host. A. columbi extinction was also affected by the  matrix habitat surrounding the patch--the effect was the opposite of that for P.  crocea. Finally, vacant patches were colonized at rates of 53% and 34% per  generation for the planthopper and parasitoid, respectively. For both species,  colonization probabilities decreased with an increase in patch isolation. High  host densities in a patch also favored high rates of colonization by A. columbi.  I discuss how anthropogenic changes to the prairie landscape can affect the  metapopulation dynamics and persistence time of this host-parasitoid interaction.

TI Spatial dynamics of specialist seed predators on synchronized and intermittent
SO The American naturalist
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB Masting, the synchronized and intermittent seed production by plant populations,  provides highly variable food resources for specialist seed predators. Such a  reproductive mode helps minimize seed losses through predator satiation and  extinction of seed predator populations. The seed predators can buffer the  resource variation through dispersal or extended diapause. We developed a  spatially explicit resource-consumer model to understand the effect of masting on  specialist seed predators. The masting dynamics were assumed to follow a  resource-based model for plant reproduction, and the population dynamics of the  predator were represented by a spatially extended Nicholson-Bailey model. The  resultant model demonstrated that when host plants reproduce intermittently, seed  predator populations go locally extinct, but global persistence of the predator  is facilitated by dispersal or extended diapause. Global extinction of the  predator resulted when the intermittent reproduction is highly synchronized among  plants. An approximate invasion criterion for the predators showed that negative  lag-1 autocorrelation in seeding reduces invasibility, and positive lag-1  cross-correlation enhances invasibility. Spatial synchronization in seeding at  local scale caused by pollen coupling (or climate forcing) further prevented  invasion of the predators. If the predators employed extended diapause, extremely  high temporal variability in reproduction was required for plants to evade the  predators.

TI The accumulation of deleterious mutations within the frozen niche variation
SO Journal of evolutionary biology
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB The frozen niche variation hypothesis proposes that asexual clones exploit a  fraction of a total resource niche available to the sexual population from which  they arise. Differences in niche breadth may allow a period of coexistence  between a sexual population and the faster reproducing asexual clones. Here, we  model the longer term threat to the persistence of the sexual population from an  accumulation of clonal diversity, balanced by the cost to the asexual population  resulting from a faster rate of accumulation of deleterious mutations. We use  Monte-Carlo simulations to quantify the interaction of niche breadth with  accumulating deleterious mutations. These two mechanisms may act synergistically  to prevent the extinction of the sexual population, given: (1) sufficient genetic  variation, and consequently niche breadth, in the sexual population; (2) a  relatively slow rate of accumulation of genetic diversity in the clonal  population; (3) synergistic epistasis in the accumulation of deleterious  mutations.

TI Tolerance of pollination networks to species extinctions.
SO Proceedings. Biological sciences
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB Mutually beneficial interactions between flowering plants and animal pollinators  represent a critical 'ecosystem service' under threat of anthropogenic  extinction. We explored probable patterns of extinction in two large networks of  plants and flower visitors by simulating the removal of pollinators and  consequent loss of the plants that depend upon them for reproduction. For each  network, we removed pollinators at random, systematically from least-linked (most  specialized) to most-linked (most generalized), and systematically from most- to  least-linked. Plant species diversity declined most rapidly with preferential  removal of the most-linked pollinators, but declines were no worse than linear.  This relative tolerance to extinction derives from redundancy in pollinators per  plant and from nested topology of the networks. Tolerance in pollination networks  contrasts with catastrophic declines reported from standard food webs. The  discrepancy may be a result of the method used: previous studies removed species  from multiple trophic levels based only on their linkage, whereas our  preferential removal of pollinators reflects their greater risk of extinction  relative to that of plants. In both pollination networks, the most-linked  pollinators were bumble-bees and some solitary bees. These animals should receive  special attention in efforts to conserve temperate pollination systems.

AB There is a curious paradox in the evolutionary legacy of Ice Ages. Studies of  modern species suggest that they are currently evolving in response to changing  environments. If extrapolated into the context of Quaternary Ice Ages, this  evidence would suggest that the frequent climatic changes should have stimulated  the evolutionary process and thus increased the rates of change within species  and the number of speciation events. Extinction rates would, similarly, be high.  Quaternary insect studies call into question these interpretations. They indicate  that insect species show a remarkable degree of stability throughout the Ice Age  climatic oscillations. The paradox arises from the apparent contradiction between  abundant evidence of incipient speciation in insect populations at the present  day and the evidence that, in the geological past, this apparently did not lead  to sustained evolution.

TI Decreased sexual signalling reveals reduced viability in small populations of the
SO Proceedings. Biological sciences
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB One of the important goals in conservation biology is to determine reliable  indicators of population viability. Sexual traits have been suggested to indicate  population extinction risk, because they may be related to viability through  condition dependence. Moreover, condition-dependent sexual traits may be more  sensitive indicators of population viability than early life-history traits,  because deleterious fitness effects of inbreeding tend to be expressed mainly at  the end of the species' life history. However, empirical evidence of the  significance of sexual behaviour for population viability is missing. In this  study, we examined two male sexual traits and survival in 39 different-sized and  isolated natural populations of the wolf spider, Hygrolycosa rubrofasciata. We  also used several traits to estimate female reproductive success in 25  populations of H. rubrofasciata. According to previous studies, H. rubrofasciata  males have a costly and condition-dependent acoustic signal, courtship drumming,  which is the target of female choice. Males with a high drumming rate have  considerably higher viability than males with a low drumming rate, and females  that mate with the more actively drumming males gain genetic benefits in terms of  increased offspring viability. Our results show that males in small populations  had both lower survival and lower drumming rate than males in larger populations.  However, we did not find any evidence for a decline in important early  life-history traits (offspring number, hatching success or offspring body mass)  or female body mass in small populations. Our results have two important messages  for conservation biology. First, they show that sexual traits can be used as  sensitive indicators of population viability. Second, the indirect benefits of  female choice in terms of good genes might partially compensate for the reduction  of viability in declining populations. Also, our results support the view that  deleterious effects of small population size are expressed at the end of the  species' life history.

TI Major histocompatibility complex variation at three class II loci in the northern
SO Molecular ecology
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB Northern elephant seals were hunted to near extinction in the 19th century, yet  have recovered remarkably and now number around 175,000. We surveyed 110 seals  for single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) and sequence variation at  three major histocompatibility (MHC) class II loci (DQA, DQB and DRB) to evaluate  the genetic consequences of the population bottleneck at these loci vs. other  well-studied genes. We found very few alleles at each MHC locus, significant  variation among breeding sites for the DQA locus, and linkage disequilibrium  between the DQB and DRB loci. Northern elephant seals are evidently inbred,  although there is as yet no evidence of correlative reductions in fitness.

TI Extinction-induced immobility in the water maze and its neurochemical
SO Neurobiology of learning and memory
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB Extinction of escape behavior in the water maze due to the removal of the  platform, was hypothesized to induce a negative state, including the development  of immobility, which is held to reflect a state of "despair" when measured in the  forced swimming test. 27 aged and 8 adult animals (26 and 3 months old Wistar  rats, respectively) were tested in the water maze during nine days with a  platform hidden, followed by 7 days of extinction trials with the platform  absent. As expected, both age groups developed immobility over the extinction  trials, with the aged showing more than the adults. To examine whether the age  difference in immobility was related to performance differences during  acquisition, the aged were subdivided into superior, intermediate and inferior  learners (n = 9 per group) on the basis of overall times to platform during  acquisition, and compared with each other and the adults. Results showed that the  aged inferior learners displayed the highest levels of immobility among the aged.  Immobility scores were then correlated with post-mortem neurotransmitter contents  in the hippocampus and ventral striatum. In the ventral striatum, levels of  immobility were correlated with levels of acetylcholine, dopamine and the  metabolite dihydroxyphenylacetic acid in the aged, and with norepinephrine in the  adults. The data support the hypothesis that multiple extinction trials in the  water maze result in immobility that may indicate "behavioral despair," and that  striatal neurotransmitter systems correlate with the degree of its expression.  The concept of extinction-induced despair is held to provide the promise of a  conceptual and empirical model of human depression that is the consequence of  loss of reinforcers.

TI Harvesting in a resource dependent age structured Leslie type population model.
SO Mathematical biosciences
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB We analyse the effect of harvesting in a resource dependent age structured  population model, deriving the conditions for the existence of a stable steady  state as a function of fertility coefficients, harvesting mortality and carrying  capacity of the resources. Under the effect of proportional harvest, we give a  sufficient condition for a population to extinguish, and we show that the  magnitude of proportional harvest depends on the resources available to the  population. We show that the harvesting yield can be periodic, quasi-periodic or  chaotic, depending on the dynamics of the harvested population. For populations  with large fertility numbers, small harvesting mortality leads to abrupt  extinction, but larger harvesting mortality leads to controlled population  numbers by avoiding over consumption of resources. Harvesting can be a strategy  in order to stabilise periodic or quasi-periodic oscillations in the number of  individuals of a population.

TI A supernova origin for dust in a high-redshift quasar.
SO Nature
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB Interstellar dust plays a crucial role in the evolution of the Universe by  assisting the formation of molecules, by triggering the formation of the first  low-mass stars, and by absorbing stellar ultraviolet-optical light and  subsequently re-emitting it at infrared/millimetre wavelengths. Dust is thought  to be produced predominantly in the envelopes of evolved (age >1 Gyr), low-mass  stars. This picture has, however, recently been brought into question by the  discovery of large masses of dust in the host galaxies of quasars at redshift z >  6, when the age of the Universe was less than 1 Gyr. Theoretical studies,  corroborated by observations of nearby supernova remnants, have suggested that  supernovae provide a fast and efficient dust formation environment in the early  Universe. Here we report infrared observations of a quasar at redshift 6.2, which  are used to obtain directly its dust extinction curve. We then show that such a  curve is in excellent agreement with supernova dust models. This result  demonstrates a supernova origin for dust in this high-redshift quasar, from which  we infer that most of the dust at high redshifts probably has the same origin.

TI Extinction of the acoustic startle response in moths endemic to a bat-free
SO Journal of evolutionary biology
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB Most moths use ears solely to detect the echolocation calls of hunting,  insectivorous bats and evoke evasive flight manoeuvres. This singularity of  purpose predicts that this sensoribehavioural network will regress if the  selective force that originally maintained it is removed. We tested this with  noctuid moths from the islands of Tahiti and Moorea, sites where bats have never  existed and where an earlier study demonstrated that the ears of endemic species  resemble those of adventives although partially reduced in sensitivity. To  determine if these moths still express the anti-bat defensive behaviour of  acoustic startle response (ASR) we compared the nocturnal flight times of six  endemic to six adventive species in the presence and absence of artificial bat  echolocation sounds. Whereas all of the adventive species reduced their flight  times when exposed to ultrasound, only one of the six endemic species did so.  These differences were significant when tested using a phylogenetically based  pairwise comparison and when comparing effect sizes. We conclude that the absence  of bats in this habitat has caused the neural circuitry that normally controls  the ASR behaviour in bat-exposed moths to become decoupled from the functionally  vestigial ears of endemic Tahitian moths.

TI The relationship between species detection probability and local extinction
SO Oecologia
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB In community-level ecological studies, generally not all species present in  sampled areas are detected. Many authors have proposed the use of estimation  methods that allow detection probabilities that are <1 and that are heterogeneous  among species. These methods can also be used to estimate community-dynamic  parameters such as species local extinction probability and turnover rates  (Nichols et al. Ecol Appl 8:1213-1225; Conserv Biol 12:1390-1398). Here, we  present an ad hoc approach to estimating community-level vital rates in the  presence of joint heterogeneity of detection probabilities and vital rates. The  method consists of partitioning the number of species into two groups using the  detection frequencies and then estimating vital rates (e.g., local extinction  probabilities) for each group. Estimators from each group are combined in a  weighted estimator of vital rates that accounts for the effect of heterogeneity.  Using data from the North American Breeding Bird Survey, we computed such  estimates and tested the hypothesis that detection probabilities and local  extinction probabilities were negatively related. Our analyses support the  hypothesis that species detection probability covaries negatively with local  probability of extinction and turnover rates. A simulation study was conducted to  assess the performance of vital parameter estimators as well as other estimators  relevant to questions about heterogeneity, such as coefficient of variation of  detection probabilities and proportion of species in each group. Both the  weighted estimator suggested in this paper and the original unweighted estimator  for local extinction probability performed fairly well and provided no basis for  preferring one to the other.

TI Effects of temporal variability on rare plant persistence in annual systems.
SO The American naturalist
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB Traditional conservation biology regards environmental fluctuations as  detrimental to persistence, reducing long-term average growth rates and  increasing the probability of extinction. By contrast, coexistence models from  community ecology suggest that for species with dormancy, environmental  fluctuations may be essential for persistence in competitive communities. We used  models based on California grasslands to examine the influence of interannual  fluctuations in the environment on the persistence of rare forbs competing with  exotic grasses. Despite grasses and forbs independently possessing high fecundity  in the same types of years, interspecific differences in germination biology and  dormancy caused the rare forb to benefit from variation in the environment. Owing  to the buildup of grass competitors, consecutive favorable years proved highly  detrimental to forb persistence. Consequently, negative temporal autocorrelation,  a low probability of a favorable year, and high variation in year quality all  benefited the forb. In addition, the litter produced by grasses in a previously  favorable year benefited forb persistence by inhibiting its germination into  highly competitive grass environments. We conclude that contrary to conventional  predictions of conservation and population biology, yearly fluctuations in  climate may be essential for the persistence of rare species in invaded habitats.

TI Climate change and evolving human diversity in Europe during the last glacial.
SO Philosophical transactions of the Royal Society of London. Series B, Biological
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB A link between climate change and human evolution during the Pleistocene has  often been assumed but rarely tested. At the macro-evolutionary level Foley  showed for hominids that extinction, rather than speciation, correlates with  environmental change as recorded in the deep sea record. Our aim is to examine  this finding at a smaller scale and with high-resolution environmental and  archaeological archives. Our interest is in changing patterns of human dispersal  under shifting Pleistocene climates during the last glacial period in Europe.  Selecting this time frame and region allows us to observe how two hominid taxa,  Neanderthals and Crô-Magnons, adapted to climatic conditions during oxygen  isotope stage 3. These taxa are representative of two hominid adaptive  radiations, termed terrestrial and aquatic, which exhibited different habitat  preferences but similar tolerances to climatic factors. Their response to  changing ecological conditions was predicated upon their ability to extend their  societies in space and time. We examine this difference further using a database  of all available radiocarbon determinations from western Europe in the late  glacial. These data act as proxies for population history, and in particular the  expansion and contraction of regional populations as climate changed rapidly.  Independent assessment of these processes is obtained from the genetic history of  Europeans. The results indicate that climate affects population contraction  rather than expansion. We discuss the consequences for genetic and cultural  diversity which led to the legacy of the Ice Age: a single hominid species,  globally distributed.

TI Reduced competition and altered feeding behavior among marine snails after a mass
SO Science (New York, N.Y.)
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB Extinction may alter competitive interactions among surviving species, affecting  their subsequent recovery and evolution, but these processes remain poorly  understood. Analysis of predation traces produced by shell-drilling muricid  snails on bivalve prey reveals that species interactions were substantially  different before and after a Plio-Pleistocene mass extinction in the western  Atlantic. Muricids edge- and wall-drilled their prey in the Pliocene, but  Pleistocene and Recent snails attacked prey only through the shell wall.  Experiments with living animals suggest that intense competition induces muricid  snails to attack shell edges. Pliocene predators, therefore, probably competed  for resources more intensely than their post-extinction counterparts.

TI Exploring rarity using a general model for distribution and abundance.
SO The American naturalist
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB We describe a simple model for changes in the distribution and abundance of a  metapopulation and use it to explore the conditions leading to different types of  rarity. The model suggests that localized populations (those with low patch  occupancy but high local abundance) arise from low dispersal, low heterogeneity  in extant population size, and frequent local extinctions relative to the  potential for recolonization. Scarce populations (with low distribution and  abundance) arise when relative local extinction rate is low to moderate and  heterogeneity is high or successful dispersal is relatively low. Sparse  populations (widespread, but with low local abundance) arise when relative local  extinction rate is very low and either spatial heterogeneity or mortality through  unsuccessful dispersal is high. In sparse or common species, there may be  unstable as well as stable equilibria, implying a threshold distribution and  abundance for persistence. The model supports a general correlation between  distribution and abundance and suggests that persistence may be threatened by  dispersal rates being either too high or too low. The model provides a new  perspective on rarity and suggests a simple theoretical foundation for  understanding the population-dynamic mechanisms that determine distribution and  abundance.

TI Seasonal population dynamics of ticks, and its influence on infection
SO Bulletin of mathematical biology
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB In this paper, a simple semi-discrete (ticks' feeding is assumed to occur only  during the summers of each year) model for tick population dynamics is presented.  Conditions for existence, uniqueness, and stability of a positive equilibrium are  found; the system is then studied numerically using parameter estimates  calibrated for the tick Ixodes ricinus in Trentino, Italy, and the sensitivity to  parameters is examined. Then, this model is extended to consider a  tick-transmitted infection of one species of hosts, while other hosts are  incompetent to the infection. Assuming, for simplicity, that the infection is not  affecting the total number either of hosts or ticks, a threshold condition for  infection persistence is obtained. The dependence of the equilibrium infection  prevalence on parameters is studied numerically; in particular, we considered how  infection prevalence depends on host densities. This analysis reveals that a  'dilution effect' occurs both for competent and for incompetent hosts; this means  that, besides a lower threshold for host densities for infection to persist,  there exists also an upper threshold: if host densities were higher than the  upper threshold, the infection would go to extinction. Numerically, it is found  that, for realistic parameter values, the upper threshold is not much higher than  observed densities.

TI Adaptation to temperate climates.
SO Evolution; international journal of organic evolution
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB Only model organisms live in a world of endless summer. Fitness at temperate  latitudes reflects the ability of organisms in nature to exploit the favorable  season, to mitigate the effects of the unfavorable season, and to make the timely  switch from one life style to the other. Herein, we define fitness as Ry, the  year-long cohort replacement rate across all four seasons, of the mosquito,  Wyeomyia smithii, reared in its natural microhabitat in processor-controlled  environment rooms. First, we exposed cohorts of W. smithii, from southern,  midlatitude, and northern populations (30-50 degrees N) to southern and northern  thermal years during which we factored out evolved differences in photoperiodic  response. We found clear evidence of evolved differences in heat and cold  tolerance among populations. Relative cold tolerance of northern populations  became apparent when populations were stressed to the brink of extinction;  relative heat tolerance of southern populations became apparent when the adverse  effects of heat could accumulate over several generations. Second, we exposed  southern, midlatitude, and northern populations to natural, midlatitude day  lengths in a thermally benign midlatitude thermal year. We found that evolved  differences in photoperiodic response (1) prevented the timely entry of southern  populations into diapause resulting in a 74% decline in fitness, and (2) forced  northern populations to endure a warm-season diapause resulting in an 88% decline  in fitness. We argue that reciprocal transplants across latitudes in nature  always confound the effects of the thermal and photic environment on fitness.  Yet, to our knowledge, no one has previously held the thermal year constant while  varying the photic year. This distinction is crucial in evaluating the potential  impact of climate change. Because global warming in the Northern Hemisphere is  proceeding faster at northern than at southern latitudes and because this change  represents an amelioration of the thermal environment and a concomitant increase  in the duration of the growing season, we conclude that there should be more  rapid evolution of photoperiodic response than of thermal tolerance as a  consequence of global warming among northern, temperate ectotherms.

AB The unified neutral theory of biodiversity and biogeography provides a dynamic  null hypothesis for the assembly of natural communities. It is also useful for  understanding the influence of speciation, extinction, dispersal and ecological  drift on patterns of relative species abundance, species-area relationships and  phylogeny. Clark and McLachlan argue that neutral drift is inconsistent with the  palaeorecord of stability in fossil pollen assemblages of the Holocene forests of  southern Canada. We show here that their analysis is based on a partial  misunderstanding of neutral theory and that their data alone cannot unambiguously  test its validity.

AB Despite its significance regarding the conservation and management of biological  resources, the body of theory predicting that the correlation between successive  environmental states can profoundly influence extinction has not been empirically  validated. Identical clonal populations from a model experimental system based on  the collembolan Folsomia candida were used in the present study to investigate  the effect of environmental autocorrelation on time to extinction. Environmental  variation was imposed by variable implementation (present/absent) of a culling  procedure according to treatments that represented six patterns of environmental  autocorrelation. The average number of culling events was held constant across  treatments but, as environmental autocorrelation increased, longer runs of both  favourable and unfavourable culling tended to occur. While no difference was  found among the survival functions for the various treatments, the time taken for  50% of the component populations to become extinct decreased significantly with  increasing environmental autocorrelation. Similarly, analysis of all extinct  populations demonstrated that time to extinction was shortened as environmental  autocorrelation increased. However, this acceleration of extinction can be fully  offset if sequential introduction is used in place of simultaneous introduction  when founding the populations.

TI Measuring changes in articulate brachiopod morphology before and after the
SO Evolution & development
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB The pattern of decreasing disparity has been observed in both the metazoans and  metaphytes throughout the Phanerozoic. The pattern is manifest as a decreasing  trend in the origination of higher taxa. Currently, two competing evolutionary  hypotheses have been proposed to explain this phenomenon: the empty ecospace  hypothesis and the developmental constraint hypothesis. To empirically  distinguish between these hypotheses, the change in disparity before and after  the end-Permian mass extinction event was measured in the articulated  brachiopods. The assumption is that ecospace-limiting constraints are removed  after mass extinctions revealing the effect of developmental constraints. For  each taxon within the group, both continuous and discrete character sets were  analyzed. Four different measures of disparity were used to analyze each  character suite. Additionally, a separate analysis was performed on a subset of  the articulated brachiopods, the rhynchonellids and terebratulids. In most cases  investigated, disparity rebounded to comparable levels, with the rhynchonellids  and terebratulids showing the largest increase in disparity after the end-Permian  extinction, a clear example of an increase in disparity without a significant  increase in taxonomic diversity. The results indicate that developmental  constraints may not be responsible for the decreasing disparity in this group.  The more likely scenario is that increasingly structured ecological guilds have  made it much more difficult for large increases in disparity to occur.

TI Morphological disparity of ammonoids and the mark of Permian mass extinctions.
SO Science (New York, N.Y.)
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB The taxonomic diversity of ammonoids, in terms of the number of taxa preserved,  provides an incomplete picture of the extinction pattern during the Permian  because of a strongly biased fossil record. The analysis of morphological  disparity (the variety of shell shapes) is a powerful complementary tool for  testing hypotheses about the selectivity of extinction and permits the  recognition of three distinct patterns. First, a trend of decreasing disparity,  ranging for about 30 million years, led to a minimum disparity immediately before  the Permian-Triassic boundary. Second, the strongly selective Capitanian crisis  fits a model of background extinction driven by standard environmental changes.  Third, the end-Permian mass extinction operated as a random, nonselective sorting  of morphologies, which is consistent with a catastrophic cause.

TI Resistance to extinction is associated with impaired immediate early gene
SO The European journal of neuroscience
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB Extinction of classical fear conditioning is thought to involve  activity-dependent potentiation of synaptic transmission in the medial prefrontal  cortex (mPFC), resulting in the inhibition of amygdala-dependent fear responses.  While many studies have addressed the mechanisms underlying extinction learning,  it is unclear what determines whether extinction memory is consolidated or  whether spontaneous recovery of the fear response occurs. Here we show, using a  combined electrophysiological and immunocytochemical approach, that spontaneous  recovery of conditioned fear in mice is associated with a prolonged expression of  long-term depression of synaptic transmission in the mPFC and the failure of  induction of the immediate-early genesc-Fos and zif268 in the mPFC and the  basolateral nucleus of the amygdala. This suggests that coordinated  activity-dependent changes in gene expression in the mPFC and the amygdala may  underlie the formation of long-term fear extinction memory.

TI Distance-dependence in two Amazonian palms: effects of spatial and temporal
SO Oecologia
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB Animals aid population growth and fitness in tropical forest communities through  dispersal and negatively impact populations through seed predation. The  interaction between dispersal and seed predation can produce distance- or  density-dependence; powerful mechanisms for maintaining species diversity  incorporated in the Janzen-Connell model. Large mammals, the highest biomass seed  predators of intact Amazonian communities and at risk due to human disturbance,  are potentially central to these interactions. This study tests the  Janzen-Connell model and investigates the impact of mammalian seed predators on  seedling recruitment and maintenance of tree diversity. Patterns of both  vertebrate and invertebrate seed predation and seedling recruitment were studied  in the two most abundant canopy tree species in western Amazonia (Arecaceae:  Astrocaryum murumuru and Iriartea deltoidea). We specifically examined effects of  both spatial and temporal variation of the highest biomass seed predator in  southwest Amazonian forests, the white-lipped peccary ( Tayassu pecari), on  recruitment through disturbed and undisturbed sites and through a fortuitous 12  year natural extinction and recolonization event of T. pecari. Distance-dependent  seedling recruitment was found in Astrocaryum and Iriartea at both sites.  However, the median distance of seedlings was approximately 1.5x farther from  reproductive adults in both palms at the undisturbed site. The number of Iriartea  seeds escaping predation increased 6,000% in both space and time due to the  decline of T. pecari abundance. The results demonstrate that Janzen-Connell  effects are stronger in intact ecosystems and tie these mechanistically to  changes in seed predator abundance. This study shows that anthropogenic changes  in mammal communities decrease the magnitude of Janzen-Connell effects in  Amazonian forests and may result in decreases in tree diversity.

TI Species coextinctions and the biodiversity crisis.
SO Science (New York, N.Y.)
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB To assess the coextinction of species (the loss of a species upon the loss of  another), we present a probabilistic model, scaled with empirical data. The model  examines the relationship between coextinction levels (proportion of species  extinct) of affiliates and their hosts across a wide range of coevolved  interspecific systems: pollinating Ficus wasps and Ficus, parasites and their  hosts, butterflies and their larval host plants, and ant butterflies and their  host ants. Applying a nomographic method based on mean host specificity (number  of host species per affiliate species), we estimate that 6300 affiliate species  are "coendangered" with host species currently listed as endangered. Current  extinction estimates need to be recalibrated by taking species coextinctions into  account.

TI Determination of pyrrolized phospholipids in oxidized phospholipid vesicles and
SO Analytical biochemistry
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB The Ehrlich reaction was optimized to determine pyrrolized phospholipids produced  as a consequence of oxidative stress. The procedure consisted of the treatment of  the modified phospholipids with p-(dimethylamino)benzaldehyde at a controlled  acidity temperature and the spectrophotometric determination of adducts produced.  The extinction coefficient of Ehrlich adducts was calculated by using  1-[1-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1H-pyrrol-2-yl]propan-1-ol (compound 1) as standard and was  56,500 M(-1)cm(-1). The response was linear and reproducible within the range of  0.051-7.65 microM of compound 1. When the assay was applied to determination of  pyrrole content in ethanolamine incubated in the presence of 0.25-1mM of  4,5(E)-epoxy-2(E)-heptenal, the complete conversion of the aldehyde into the  pyrrole ring was observed and the results obtained were similar to those found  when compound 1 was determined by gas chromatography. When  phosphatidylethanolamine was incubated in the presence of 0.5-40 mM of  4,5(E)-epoxy-2(E)-heptenal, the phospholipid was pyrrolized similarly to  ethanolamine, although there was not a quantitative conversion and the amount of  pyrroles produced depended on the pH of the media. Pyrrolized phospholipids were  also produced when phosphatidylethanolamine multilamellar vesicles where oxidized  in the presence of either Fe(3+)/ascorbic acid or ABAP  (2,2'-azobis(2-methylpropionamide) dihydrochloride) and when high-density  lipoproteins were incubated in the presence of Cu(2+), thereby confirming that  phospholipid pyrrolization is a common consequence of oxidative stress and that  Ehrlich adducts may be valid for determining this pyrrolization.

TI Can extinction rates be estimated without fossils?
SO Journal of theoretical biology
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB There is considerable interest in the possibility of using molecular phylogenies  to estimate extinction rates. The present study aims at assessing the statistical  performance of the birth-death model fitting approach to estimate speciation and  extinction rates by comparison to the approach considering fossil data. A  simulation-based approach was used. The diversification of a large number of  lineages was simulated under a wide range of speciation and extinction rate  values. The estimators obtained with fossils performed better than those without  fossils. In the absence of fossils (e.g. with a molecular phylogeny), the  speciation rate was correctly estimated in a wide range of situations; the bias  of the corresponding estimator was close to zero for the largest trees. However,  this estimator was substantially biased when the simulated extinction rate was  high. On the other hand the estimator of extinction rate was biased in a wide  range of situations. Surprisingly, this bias was lesser with medium-sized trees.  Some recommendations for interpreting results from a diversification analysis are  given.

TI How species respond to multiple extinction threats.
SO Proceedings. Biological sciences
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB It is well established that different species vary in their vulnerability to  extinction risk and that species biology can underpin much of this variation. By  contrast, very little is known about how the same species responds to different  threat processes. The purpose of this paper is therefore twofold: to examine the  extent to which a species' vulnerability to different types of threat might  covary and to explore the biological traits that are associated with  threat-specific responses. We use an objective and quantitative measure of local  extinction risk to show that vulnerability to local population decline in  primates varies substantially among species and between threat types. Our results  show that a species' response to one threat type does not predict its response to  others. Multivariate analyses also suggest that different mechanisms of decline  are associated with each type of threat, since different biological traits are  correlated with each threat-specific response. Primate species at risk from  forestry tend to exhibit low ecological flexibility, while those species  vulnerable to agriculture tend to live in the canopy and eat low-fruit diets; in  further contrast, primates at risk from hunting tend to exhibit large body size.  Our analyses therefore indicate that a species' vulnerability to local extinction  can be highly variable and is likely to depend on both threat type and biology.
