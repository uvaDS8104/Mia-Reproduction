AB Using IRAS infrared data and H-alpha CCD data for a sample of 38 far-infrared selected starburst galaxies with far-infrared luminosities ranging from 10(9) to 5 10(11) L., we find that the far-infrared and H-alpha luminosities are correlated. The average value of log(L(FIR)/L(H-alpha)0) equals 1.9 +/- 0.1. The H-alpha luminosities have been corrected for reddening using H-alpha/H-beta line ratios. The relation between the far-infrared and uncorrected H-alpha luminosities of optically selected normal galaxies and far-infrared selected starburst galaxies indicates that the dust absorption in H-alpha increases smoothly with increasing luminosities. Application of a simple starburst model to the L(FIR)/L(H-alpha)0 correlation indicates that in a starburst stars are formed up to masses of 60 M.. Star formation rates derived for these starburst galaxies range from 0.3 to 300 M.yr-1. Estimates of the available gas masses indicate that these star formation rates can be sustained for at least 10(8) yr.

ID gasb super-lattices; layer
AB We have used the technique of molecular beam epitaxy to grow InAs on GaSb, GaSb on InAs, and InAs/InxGa1-xSb (0 less-than-or-equal-to x less-than-or-equal-to 0.4) multilayered structures and have performed a detailed investigation of the layers and resultant interfaces. The structures were grown on (100) oriented GaSb or GaAs substrates. Combined reflection high energy electron diffraction, x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and Auger electron spectroscopy (AES) studies indicate that Sb is persistently present on the InAs growth surface. XPS and AES analysis of InAs/GaSb heterojunctions indicates no compound formation at either the InAs/GaSb or GaSb/InAs interface. Secondary ion mass spectroscopy (SIMS) and XPS extinction profiles reveal the presence of approximately 5-10% As in the nominally pure GaSb layers. Analysis of InAs/GaSb/GaSb (100) structures by SIMS indicates that the As is incorporated during growth. The multilayer structures have been characterized by double crystal x-ray diffraction and the data has been modeled using kinematic formulations. We find that the experimental data is fitted by assuming atomically abrupt composition changes across the interfaces.

TI THE STRUCTURE OF TURBULENT NONPREMIXED FLAMES OF METHANOL OVER A RANGE OF MIXING RATES
SO COMBUSTION AND FLAME
LA English
DT Article
ID air; extinction
AB The blowoff and electrical connectedness characteristics of pilot-stabilized turbulent nonpremixed flames of methanol fuel are presented. Using the joint Raman-Rayleigh-LIF technique, simultaneous space- and time-resolved measurements of temperature and the mass fractions of CH3OH, CO, CO2, H2, H2O, O2, and N2 are also shown for a number of measurement locations. Flames with slow mixing rates as well as ones close to blowoff are investigated. The results are presented in the form of scatter plots as well as probability density functions conditioned with respect to mixture fraction for a number of mixture fraction ranges selected within the reactive zone for methanol. The local extinction characteristics in the flames are also studied by adopting a temperature threshold below which fluid samples are assumed to be extinguished. It is found that the flame becomes electrically disconnected completely while it remains visibly and aurally stable for a range of velocities just below blowoff. Measurements in regions of the flames where the mixing rates are relatively low show little difference between the turbulent flame data and the laminar flame compositions only on the lean side of stoichiometric. For rich mixtures, however, the peak-measured mass fractions of CO and H2 are about 70% higher than those for laminar flamelets while the mass fractions of CO2 and H2O are lower than those of highly stretched laminar flamelets. Localized extinction remains uniformly low until the flame jet velocity is about 80% of the blowoff velocity. With higher flame jet velocities, localized extinction increases sharply until global blowoff is reached. The flame's approach to global blowoff is mainly bimodal for lean and stoichiometric mixtures but less bimodal for rich ones. This bimodality, however, is less distinct than in methane flames.

AB The western margin of India, especially the area surrounding the gravity high of Bombay, is covered by a thick pile of Deccan flood basalts. The massive eruption is one of the largest continental volcanic events at the Cretaceous/Tertiary biological mass extinction boundary (approximately 65 Ma ago). The area is characterized by several hidden tectonic features, and their origin and evolution have remained controversial. In the search for magma source structure, attention was focused on an unusual oval-shaped positive gravity anomaly over the Bombay coastal zone. The gravity analysis indicates the presence of two subsurface structures at depths of 4.5 +/- 0.5 km and 18 +/- 2 km. These depths correspond to the top of the crustal basaltic layer and an upwarped Moho discontinuity, respectively. The positive gravity anomaly in three-dimensional analysis reveals a possible magma conduit structure and the near absence of the granitic layer. The unusually shallow Moho layer coincides with the region of a broad high heat flow anomaly (average heat flow more than 80 mW/m2). The geophysical signatures from the neighborhood show that the asthenosphere has welled up considerably and is located at a depth of about 40 km. High heat flow and asthenospheric depth estimates suggest melting conditions at very shallow depths. It is suggested that the highly differentiated magma associated with the major eruptive phase of Deccan Traps did not originate at the D" layer. It is hypothesized that magma was brought to the surface by a major secondary plume at a much shallower depth within the lithosphere and possibly at the crust-mantle boundary, as a consequence of subcrustal erosion and secondary melting caused by the extreme velocity of India during the late Cretaceous and early Tertiary. Substantial melting of the base of the lithosphere due to frictional heating might have resulted in the accumulation of a large quantity of magma below the thinned lithosphere at the pre-existing fracture zone near the continental margin. The presence of a magmatic conduit structure above the Moho, derived from the inversion of gravity data and other tectonic conditions, suggests a possible triggering of the magma reservoir by a large bolide impact (approximately 10 km diameter) at the Cretaceous/Tertiary boundary near Bombay.

AB It has been suggested that free-free emission from symbiotic stars should become optically thin at submillimetre and millimetre wavelengths. We present 0.45-2.0 mm continuum measurements for a selected sample of symbiotic stars, H2-38, HM Sagittae, V1016 Cygni, AG Pegasi and R Aquarii. These observations clearly confirm that the D-type symbiotic stars HM Sge and V1016 Cyg exhibit a spectral turnover at a wavelength of approximately 3 cm. The 1.1-2.0 min spectral indices for these sources agree well with that expected for optically thin free-free emission. Contemporaneous optical H-beta intensities are combined with submillimetre free-free flux densities to determine the extinction due to circumstellar and interstellar dust. In addition, the 0.45-0.8 mm data for HM Sge and V1016 Cyg tentatively suggest that an extra emission component may be contributing to the observed flux densities at shorter wavelengths. This may be interpreted as either cold dust emitting at a temperature of approximately 10-20 K or as emission from an optically thick, ionized stellar wind within the cavity evacuated by the last outburst. If the former interpretation is accepted then estimated dust masses (M(d) approximately 0.01 M.) suggest that this additional component may be the first evidence of material ejected during an earlier evolutionary phase of these systems.

TI EARLY TRIASSIC STROMATOLITES AS POST MASS EXTINCTION DISASTER FORMS
SO GEOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
ID western-australia
AB Aftermaths of mass extinctions have been thought to be characterized by relaxation of ecological constraints, accompanied by increased prominence of opportunistic generalists. Such taxa, termed "disaster forms," have been shown to increase dramatically in range and abundance after several mass extinction events. The Cambrian-Ordovician stromatolite decline in normal-marine level-bottom environments has been explained as a direct or indirect consequence of increases in ecological constraints, such as greater levels of predation and/or bioturbation of microbial communities, caused by early Paleozoic benthic invertebrate evolution and diversification. Thus, one would predict that in post-Ordovician strata, stromatolites might appear in normal-marine level-bottom environments as disaster forms in the aftermaths of mass extinctions particularly devastating to the benthic biota, such as during Early Triassic time. Mounded stromatolites are present in two beds (up to 1.5 m thick) of the Lower Triassic (Spathian) Virgin Limestone Member (Moenkopi Formation) in the southwestern Spring Mountains of Nevada. Stromatolites from level-bottom normal-marine subtidal environments have also been described from other Lower Triassic strata in North America, Europe, and Asia. These stromatolites, unusual in level-bottom normal-marine settings, may have developed locally during the long aftermath (4-5 m.y.) of the Permian-Triassic mass extinction because of partial relaxation of the ecological constraints that typically restricted them from unstressed subtidal, normal-marine, level-bottom environments.

AB A new model for interstellar grains is presented, based on a revised version of the model of Rowan-Robinson. The main new features are the incorporation of very small grains (a = 5-20 angstrom) to explain the diffuse mid-infrared emission and the addition of very large grains (a = 30 mum) to explain excess emission at millimetre wavelengths. The model provides an excellent fit to the interstellar extinction curve and to the far-infrared spectrum of dust in our Galaxy. The model is compared to observed far-infrared colour-colour diagrams for galaxies, both for those galaxies unresolved by IRAS and for nearby, resolved galaxies. The far-infrared spectra of the large, nearby spirals mapped by IRAS, for which the emission is predominantly cirrus, are modelled in detail. The inferred dust extinctions averaged over the galactic discs are found to be small, A(V) = 0.006-0.1, though the values in the central 40 per cent of the galaxies, where the bulk of the far-infrared emission is produced, are likely to be a factor of 6 or so higher. The concept of optically thick spiral galaxies advocated by Disney, Davies & Phillips and Valentijn is not supported by this work. Models are also given for the infrared-to-submillimetre spectra of galaxies which have been mapped at 800 mum, incorporating starburst and cirrus models. The starburst component also appears to require the 30-mum grain component. The accuracy of the dust masses derived from modelling far-infrared spectra is enormously improved if observations at long wavelengths are available.

AB We investigate the evolution with galactic age of the broad-band spectrum of disc galaxies over the whole frequency range from UV to far-IR. The star formation rate and the gas metallicity are computed as a function of time by solving the standard equations for chemical evolution and are tested against data for our own galaxy. The isochrones constructed by Bertelli et al. (1990), based on the most up-to-date stellar evolution models, have been used. The tables of conversion (giving magnitudes and colours) provided by the same authors have been complemented with Johnson's (1965, 1966) data, on the red/IR side, and with Kurucz's (1979) models and IUE data on the UV side. The evolution of internal extinction in discs, as a function of the gas fraction and metallicity, has been taken into account following Guiderdoni & Rocca-Volmerange (1987). Diffuse dust emission has been modelled in terms of two components: warm dust, located in regions of high radiation intensity, yielding a contribution proportional to the star formation rate, and cold dust, heated by the general interstellar radiation field. Emission from hot circumstellar dust clouds at different galactic ages was also estimated. The model reproduces well the present broad-band spectrum of our own Galaxy over about four decades in frequency. The bolometric luminosity of disc galaxies is found to vary only weakly for galactic ages ranging from 2 to 15 Gyr. Spectral variations over the same time interval are also relatively minute: the most conspicuous changes are expected to amount to a factor is-approximately-equal-to 3 and to occur at blue-UV wavelengths and around is-approximately-equal-to 25-mu-m (in the galaxy frame).

AB We study 23 planetary nebulae whose post-AGB central stars have been previously analyzed using direct spectroscopic non-LTE methods. A comparison of spectroscopic T(eff)'s with Zanstra and Stoy (energy balance) temperatures shows that most PN in our sample are optically thin in the H Lyman continuum. This fact is confirmed as the main reason for the existence of a Zanstra discrepancy between Tz(H) and Tz(HeII). We find a good correlation between spectroscopic T(eff) and nebular excitation class, for excitation classes less-than-or-equal-to 5. We redetermine stellar masses, luminosities and distances using corrected stellar surface gravities, and calculate bolometric corrections. We obtain a well-defined relation between nebular excitation classes less-than-or-equal-to 5 and bolometric corrections. This offers one way of finding the luminosity of a central star without assuming that the PN absorbs all the ionizing photons, if good estimates of stellar apparent magnitude, distance and extinction are available. We compare our central star luminosities with those obtained assuming that the PN are completely optically thick, and show that most PN in our sample are absorbing a rather small fraction of the central star ionizing radiation. This fraction decreases as the central star becomes hotter. We also explain why other authors have concluded that most PN are completely optically thick. We obtain the nebular ionized mass - radius relation using our 23 PN, and find that: (a) it is very similar to other mass-radius relations recently determined using Magellanic Cloud and Galactic bulge PN; (b) there are many optically thin PN in the increasing-mass part of the mass-radius relation. In this way we show that the existence of a trend of increasing ionized nebular mass with increasing nebular radius is not by any means a proof that the corresponding PN are absorbing all the H Lyman continuum photons produced by their central stars. Finally, we show that a low nebular excitation class is not a safe criterion for complete optical thickness. In general, we argue that central star luminosity estimates based on the assumption of complete nebular optical thickness in the H Lyman continuum are not reliable and must be considered only as lower limits.

TI EPISODES OF TERRESTRIAL GEOLOGIC ACTIVITY DURING THE PAST 260 MILLION YEARS: A QUANTITATIVE APPROACH
SO CELESTIAL MECHANICS & DYNAMICAL ASTRONOMY
LA English

DE Episodes; geologic activity; correlation; biologic extinctions; periodicity; extraterrestrial impacts
AB Records of major geologic events of the past similar to 260 Myr including: biologic extinction events, ocean-anoxic and black-shale events, major changes in sea level, major evaporite (salt) deposits, continental flood-basalt eruptions, first-order discontinuities in sea-floor spreading, and major mountain building events, have been aggregated and analyzed with moving-window and spectral techniques that facilitate recognition of clustering and possible cyclicity. Significant clustering of events suggests a model in which changes in rates and directions of sea-floor spreading ("ridge jumps") are associated with episodic rifting, volcanism, mountain building, global sea level and changes in the composition of the earth's atmosphere via the carbon cycle. Variation in atmospheric CO(2) affects global climate, ocean circulation and marine productivity. The geologic data formally show a statistically significant underlying periodicity of 26.6 Myr for the Mesozoic and Cenozoic (the exact period differs with minor changes in geologic dating). Phase information suggests that the most recent maximum of the cycle occurred within the last 9 Myr, and may be close to the present time. The quasi-regular pulses of activity might be related to internal earth processes. However, a similar periodicity in impact craters and in galactic dynamics, and a one-to-one correlation among mass extinctions, large impact events, and flood-basalt volcanism, indicate an extraterrestrial pacemaker.

AB The diversity of body sizes of organisms has traditionally been explained in terms of microevolutionary processes: natural selection owing to differential fitness of individual organisms, or to macroevolutionary processes: species selection owing to the differential proliferation of phylogenetic lineages. Data for terrestrial mammals and birds indicate that even on a logarithmic scale frequency distributions of body mass among species are significantly skewed towards larger sizes. We used simulation models to evaluate the extent to which macro- and microevolutionary processes are sufficient to explain these distributions. Simulations of a purely cladogenetic process with no bias in extinction or speciation rates for different body sizes did not produce skewed log body mass distributions. Simulations that included size-biased extinction rates, especially those that incorporated anagenetic size change within species between speciation and extinction events, regularly produced skewed distributions. We conclude that although cladogenetic processes probably play a significant role in body size evolution, there must also be a significant anagenetic component. The regular variation in the form of mammalian body size distributions among different-sized islands and continents suggests that environmental conditions, operating through both macro- and microevolutionary processes, determine to a large extent the diversification of body sizes within faunas. Macroevolution is not decoupled from microevolution.

TI INTERSTELLAR MATTER IN EARLY-TYPE GALAXIES .2. THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN GASEOUS COMPONENTS AND GALAXY TYPES

AB In an earlier work we compiled a data base for six tracers of interstellar gas for the 467 early-type galaxies in the Revised Shapley-Ames catalog: H I, H-2, dust, optical emission-line gas, radio continuum emission, and X-ray-emitting gas. Here this data set is analyzed in an effort to understand the gaseous content by galaxy type and the relationship between gaseous components. Some new observations are presented for 21 cm H I emission (20 galaxies), CO (1-0) emission (18 galaxies), and 6 cm emission maps (11 galaxies). In elliptical galaxies the interstellar medium is dominated by the hot gaseous component, while in the Sa galaxies, cold interstellar material accounts for most of the gaseous mass; SO galaxies are intermediate, with similar amounts of hot and cold material. Normalized by optical luminosity, the H I and H-2 masses decrease so sharply from Sa- to E-type galaxies that almost no elliptical galaxies have detectable atomic or molecular gas. A similar but considerably less dramatic gradient is present between the normalized dust mass and galaxy type. A close relationship exists between the CO and IRAS fluxes, for 100-mu-m flux densities above 2 Jy. Whereas 6 cm emission is closely related to IRAS emission and star formation in spiral galaxies, the dispersion in this relationship becomes large for the earliest type galaxies, probably due to radio emission from low-luminosity AGNs. Radio emission is correlated with the presence of emission lines, both of which may be tracers of an active nucleus. In contrast to the cold interstellar components, the normalized X-ray emission is independent of galaxy type in E through SO/Sa systems, while the Sa and peculiar galaxies are slightly X-ray-poor. The X-ray luminosity is strongly dependent on the optical (blue) luminosity. The nature of this dependence is a function of the distance model. The simplest Hubble flow yields L(X) is-proportional-to L(B)1.75. We discuss an alternative distance model which yields L(X) is-proportional-to L(B)2.45, a relation which is in conflict with simple cooling flow models. The dispersion of the X-ray luminosity about this regression line is unlikely to result from stripping. The striking lack of clear correlations between hot and cold interstellar components, taken together with their morphologies, suggests that the cold gas is a disk phenomenon while the hot gas is a bulge phenomenon, with little interaction between the two. Then, the progression of galaxy type from E to Sa is not only a sequence of decreasing stellar bulge-to-disk ratio, but also of hot-to-cold-gas ratio.

AB We have computed the gamma-ray energy deposition functions, light curves and spectra for a set of theoretical Type la supernova models including deflagration, detonation, delayed detonation and tamped detonation models. The results have been obtained with a Monte Carlo gamma-ray deposition scheme which takes into account all relevant gamma-transitions and interaction processes. The spectra have been calculated with a high energy resolution. This allowed us to compute accurate line profiles, which are characteristic of the velocity and Ni-58-mass distribution of the supernova model. From the spectra computed at different epochs we have also determined the evolution of the line ratios of the strongest Ni-56 and Co-56-lines. Our computations show that Type la supernova models can be discriminated and the absolute amount of Ni-56 synthesized in the event can be determined on the basis of the gamma-ray light curves and spectra. We find that both the gamma-ray energy deposition function and the appearance of the gamma-rays are mainly determined by the Ni-56-distribution and the expansion rate of the ejecta. The density structure of the ejecta is of less importance. Our results further show that measurements of line profiles can be used to constrain the central density of the progenitor, and that line ratios provide important information about the Ni-56-distribution in the outer layers of ejecta. Although some of these gamma-rav data (light curves, line fluxes and line ratios) can be measured by the Gamma Ray Observatory (GRO) for the closest (less-than-or-equal-to 10 Mpc) supernovae, detailed spectral data will only be obtainable with the proposed high-resolution (E/delta-E = 500) gamma-ray spectral imagers NAE and INTEGRAL. The gamma-ray signature can also be used to obtain an independent determination of the Hubble constant, which is unbiased by extinction effects. The determination requires that a Type la supernova must be observed, e.g.. by the Gamma Rav Observatory (GRO), at least at two different epochs, one of which has to be within about two weeks after the explosion. Observational implications of our results for the optical light curves and optical spectra of Type Ia supernovae are discussed, too.

AB This Paper II presents an analysis of the stellar and nebular photometric observations (published in Paper I) of the LMC H II region N 159 A and its surroundings. We have identified the probable exciting stars of N 159 A and of its smaller neighbor H II regions. Fourteen O-B2 stars are present in this field of 1.'6 x 2."5. N 159 A itself is ionized by a close pair of stars of probable spectral types 0 5 to 0 6 V, and 0 7 to 0 8 V; these stars are separated by 1."O and are affected by a visual extinction of 1.2 to 1.4 mag. The protostar of Jones et al. (1986), lying at the border of N 159 A, corresponds to an H-alpha emission object which is possibly a very compact H II region or a Herbig Ae/Be star. The young stellar population (associated with the H II regions) is superposed on an older population of giants, aged 10(9) yr or more. The observed stellar content of N 159 A successfully accounts for the level of ionization of the gas as well as for this region's radio continuum and Balmer line emission.

AB We present photometric and spectroscopic observations of the classical T Tauri stars in the Chamaeleon II dark cloud. The distance to Cha II is 200 +/- 20 pc, based on a plot of extinction versus distance for field stars seen against the cloud. The ages of the pre-main-sequence stars in Cha II range between 10(5) and  10(7) yr. The stellar population of the Cha II cloud consists mostly of low mass stars-at least 17 of the 19 known T Tauri stars in Cha II have masses less than 1M . . The only intermediate mass star in the cloud is IRAS 12496-7650, a highly embedded Herbig Ae star. The mass function of Cha II resembles that of the Lupus complex, and there are a larger fraction of low mass stars in Cha II than there are in the Taurus-Auriga region.

AB The RS CVn-type eclipsing binary RZ Eridani has been monitored in the 7 colours of the Geneva photometric system between November 1977 and April 1989. It is shown that the primary is an A8-F0IV star and has been stable during the survey. The distortion of the light curve between eclipses, the migration wave, is entirely due to the variability of the secondary component, a G8-K0IV-III star. This variability is characterized by: a starspot effect varying from year to year, with a period of about 35 d, related to the stellar rotation period; a reflection effect of the light of the primary component, with a period equal to the orbital one; a long-term effect which could be due to a stellar activity cycle. The light curve has been corrected for the secondary component variability and analysed with the program EBOP (Etzel, 1980). The existence of the secondary eclipse at phase 0.67 is confirmed and the following parameters are derived, by using in addition the results of Popper (1988) from the radial velocity curves of both components: orbit: P = 39d.28254 T(o) = 2446048.883 e = 0.377 omega = -47-degrees-3 i = 89-degrees-30 radii: R(A) = 2.79 +/- 0.12R. (hotter star) and R(B) = 6.80 +/- 0.23R. (cooler star) masses: M(A) = 1.69 +/- 0.06M. and M(B) = 1.63 +/- 0.13M. The effective temperatures, luminosities and age are also determined. The light from RZ Eri is affected by a rather strong reddening, E(B-V) = 0.20 for d = 180pc and b = -33-degrees, probably mostly due to circumstellar material. The spectral types of both components and the amount of reddening are confirmed by the analysis of UV low resolution spectra obtained from the IUE satellite database. It is shown that the extinction law for this circumstellar matter is similar to the standard interstellar extinction law. The orbit of RZ Eri is not yet circularized, but this ought to occur when the cooler component which is now at the bottom of the red giant branch, will have evolved past the tip of this branch, because its radius will reach there a maximum value of more than 30 R. The hotter component, located at the end of the main-sequence stage, rotates faster (P(rot) approximately 2d.5) than the pseudosynchronisation period of RZ Eri P(ps) = 20d.4, while the cooler component rotates slower (P(rot) approximately 34d) than P(ps). This is a consequence of the difference in the evolutionary stages of both components, RZ Eri B having experienced a rapid expansion of its radius during its recent crossing of the Hertzsprung gap.

AB Estimates of visibility under natural conditions, spatial and temporal trends in atmospheric aerosol, and extinction are examined at a national level. It is found that the best visibility is in the inner mountain west, while the poorest visibility is east of the Mississippi River and in the urban areas of California. Aerosol concentrations' spatial trends generally follow this East-West trend, and fine mass concentrations are about a factor of four greater in the East than West, with sulfates and organics being the largest constituents. Sulfates are the largest single contributor to visibility degradation, with nitrates and organics contributing significantly in some regions of the country. In both the East and the West, historical changes in visibility show a high degree of correlation with increases in sulfur dioxide emissions. Source receptor modeling shows that in the Southwest, southern California, copper smelters in southern Arizona, and large sulfur dioxide sources along the Gulf Coast of Mexico contribute to elevated sulfate levels. A coal fired power plant and wood processing facilities contribute to elevated sulfate in the Northwest, while a nickel smelter in Canada and coal fired power plants in the New York and Philadelphia area are the cause of high sulfate concentrations in the Northeast. Coal fired power plants along the Ohio River Valley are one of the single largest contributors to elevated sulfate in both Shenandoah and Great Smoky Mountains National Parks.

AB As part of a stellar population sampling program, a series of photometric probes at various field sizes and depths have been obtained in a low-extinction window in the Galactic anticenter direction. Such data set strong constraints on the radial structure of the disk. At the forefront of this "drilling" program, very deep CCD frames probe the most external parts of the disk. Over the whole effective magnitude range (18-25), all contributions in the statistics which should be expected from old disk stars beyond 6 kpc vanish, although such stars dominate by far at distances less than 5 kpc. This is the signature of a sharp cutoff in the star density: the edge of the Galactic disk between 5.5 and 6 kpc. As a consequence, the Galactic radius does not exceed 14 kpc (assuming R. = 8.5). Colors of elliptical galaxies measured in the field rule out the risk of being misled by undetected extinction.

AB Approximately 130 terrestrial hypervelocity impact craters are currently known. Due to variations in preservation and in geologic knowledge, this sample is biased towards young (< 200 Ma), large (> 20 km) craters on the cratons of Australia, Europe (including the former U.S.S.R.) and North America. The rate of discovery of new craters is 3-5 craters per year. Although modified by erosion, terrestrial impact craters exhibit the range of morphologies observed for craters on other terrestrial planetary bodies, such as the Moon. Terrestrial craters provide essential ground truth data on the geologic effects of impact and the subsurface structure of impact craters, which can be used to constrain interpretations of lunar samples and models of crater formation. Due to erosion and its effects on form, terrestrial craters are recognized primarily by the occurrence of shock metamorphic effects. These include: shatter cones, microscopic planar deformation features, solid-state and fusion glasses, high pressure polymorphs and whole rock melting and Vaporization. Shock recovery experiments indicate that these features occur over shock pressures of greater-than-or-equal-to 5 GPa to > 100 GPa. Terrestrial craters have a set of geophysical characteristics which are largely the result of the passage of a shock wave and impact-induced fracturing. They include gravity and magnetic lows and reductions in seismic velocity. The gravity anomalies are seldom greater than approximately 30 mGal, due to the limiting effects of lithostatic pressure on fracturing. At large complex craters, the gravity signature may include a central relative gravity high, due to uplift, and short wavelength central magnetic anomalies, due to a variety of processes. Much current work is focused on the effects of impact on earth evolution. Previous work on shock metamorphism and the contamination of impact melt rocks by meteoritic siderophile elements provides a basis for the interpretation of the physical and chemical evidence from Cretaceous-Tertiary boundary sites as resulting from a major impact. Suggestions that other biological boundaries in the Stratigraphic record are due to periodic impacts are not supported by time series analysis of the terrestrial cratering record. By analogy with the lunar record and modelling of the effects of very large impacts, it has been proposed that biological and atmospheric evolution of the Earth could not stabilize before the end of the late heavy bombardment approximately 3.8 Ga ago. The present terrestrial cratering rate is 5.4 +/- 2.7 x 10(-15) km-2 a-1 for a diameter greater-than-or-equal-to 20 km. This represents a local threat on historic time scales. On a global scale, a major impact sufficient to cripple human civilization severely will occur on time scales of approximately 10(6) a.

TI LATE CRETACEOUS PALEOENVIRONMENTS AND BIOTAS - AN ANTARCTIC PERSPECTIVE
SO ANTARCTIC SCIENCE
LA English
DT Article
DE LATE CRETACEOUS; HIGH-LATITUDE PALEOENVIRONMENTS; EVOLUTION OF TEMPERATE BIOTAS; MASS EXTINCTIONS
AB The Cretaceous period is often regarded as one of "greenhouse" warmth, with perhaps its acme occurring in the late Albian stage (100 Ma ago). However, it is now apparent that, even at this time, there were significant meridional temperature gradients and distinct temperate biotas in the highest latitude regions. This is particularly so in the Southern Hemisphere, where an extensive Albian fossil record from Antarctica, Australia and New Zealand has revealed the presence of austral floras and faunas. With the recent improvements in stratigraphical correlations, it has become possible to trace the later Cretaceous palaeoenvironmental record in the Antarctic Peninsula region. Unfortunately, resolution of the early Late Cretaceous (Cenomanian-Coniacian stages) is still imprecise; there are some indications of strongly differentiated palynological assemblages, but studies of both macrofaunas and palaeotemperature estimates are incomplete. By the Santonian-Campanian, high-latitude biotas are well developed in the James Ross Island region and their enhancement through the final stages of the Cretaceous can be linked to a phase of global cooling. The persistence of low diversity temperate communities in high latitude regions may be of considerable ecological and evolutionary significance. For example, there is evidence to suggest that these communities may have been MoTe resistant to mass extinction events; they may also have been important source regions for replacement taxa that arose after such events.

TI FLAME PROPAGATION AND LEAN-LIMIT EXTINCTION WITHIN STRATIFIED MIXTURES INVOLVING A DILUENT GAS
SO JOURNAL OF ENERGY RESOURCES TECHNOLOGY-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME
LA English
DT Article
AB Flame propagation within confined, stratified gaseous environments were investigated experimentally. The diluents nitrogen and helium were used in turn to overlay initially combustible methane-air or hydrogen-air mixtures. Gas stratification was achieved by allowing the two initially homogeneous gases to interdiffuse for a certain period of time at constant temperature and pressure within a long, vertical, smooth, closed, circular tube. Upward flame propagation was examined following spark ignition while the tube was closed at the top but open at the bottom. Near-extinction flame speeds, lower than those predicted according to Davies and Taylor (1950), were obtained with helium dilution. Moreover, estimated reactant concentrations at the observed location of flame extinction indicated, in specific instances, that mixture stratification appears to slightly enhance locally the lean flammability limit. Nonuniform, stratified combustible gaseous mixtures and flame propagation within such mixtures are found in many situations, including in numerous technical applications, as well as in various potentially hazardous circumstances. The leakage of a fuel from storage tanks or pipelines, the formation of layered combustible mixtures within rooms, corridors, or elevator shafts of buildings, the formation of gas pockets in coal mine galleries, and the inerting of flammable mixtures through diluent gas addition are some examples. Some relevant information about the stratification process and the flame propagation characteristics in these specific circumstances has already been reported in the literature by Bakke and Leach (1962), James and Purdy (1962), Girard et al. (1979), Karim and Lam (1986) and Karim et al. (1987). This investigation considers some aspects of flame propagation and mass transfer within confined, stratified gaseous environment. The diluents nitrogen and helium were used in turn to overlay initially combustible methane-air or hydrogen-air mixtures. Mixture stratification was produced by permitting the two initially homogeneous gaseous systems to interdiffuse at constant temperature within a long, vertical, smooth, closed, circular tube. Only upward flame propagation was examined, as this mode is expected to involve the widest flammability limits and the fastest propagation for both homogeneous and stratified methane-air mixtures when confined in tubes (Liebman et al., 1971).

TI A MODEL OF THE GALACTIC DARK HALO
SO ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL
LA English
DT Article
DE COSMIC MICROWAVE BACKGROUND; DARK MATTER; GALAXIES, GENERAL; GALAXY, HALO
ID anisotropy; luminosity; distances; quasars; scales
AB Several features of galaxies are consistent with the proposition that the galactic dark halo is composed of pieces of solid matter several to tens of centimeters in size. Direct collisions among these large "grains" vaporize the grains. The vapor, which appears as hot halo gas, flows inward and forms a luminous core, the visible galaxy. Simple approximate expressions for the extent of halo gas and the mass infall rate emerge in a straightforward way. The expression for the mass infall rate, which governs the star formation rate, is consistent with the Tully-Fisher relation. Gray extinction by the grains may account for the paucity of detectable quasars at large redshifts. Because the grains are large, they are an effective cosmic thermalizing agent. Their thermalizing action smooths inhomogeneities in the primordial microwave background radiation while providing a source of nonprimordial background. The expected thermal microwave emission from galactic grain halos is near the current limits of sensitivity of relevant measurements and provides a possible test of the model.

TI SOOT FORMATION IN LAMINAR DIFFUSION FLAMES

ID prediction; sizes
AB Soot and temperature measurements were performed in sooting and non-sooting laminar diffusion flames of ethylene, ethane, n-hexane and n-hexadecane in still air. Laser light scattering and extinction was used to determine soot volume fractions and number densities. Temperatures were measured with thermocouples. Maps of soot volume fraction f(V), number density N(S), mean particle diameter D(S) and soot surface area A(S) are derived. These distributions are compared for smaller and larger fuel molecules, and for different flow rates. For the liquid fuel n-hexane the soot field is compared with spatially resolved chemical species measurements. The ethylene and ethane data are combined with modelled flame field velocities and particle trajectories to obtain local soot formation rates. The correlation of surface specific mass growth rates with local temperature and stoichiometry (calculated as mixture fraction) is discussed.

AB We report HST/Faint Object Spectrograph (FOS) and Faint Object Camera (FOC) observations of X-ray Nova Muscae 1991 obtained on 1991 May 14-15. The FOS spectrum covering 1581-4807 angstrom shows a clear 2200 angstrom absorption feature. With a fit to the continuum considering the interstellar extinction and a power-law spectrum (f(nu) is-proportional-to nu(alpha)), we determine a color excess E(B - V) approximately 0.29 and a power-law slope of alpha approximately 0.30, which approximates a canonical accretion disk spectrum. By fitting a simple model of a steady state blackbody accretion disk around a black hole to the FOS spectrum and multiepoch data in the optical, UV, and X-ray bands, we estimate the lower limit mass of the central compact object M(min), the radius of the accretion disk R(out), the maximum orbital period P(max), and the upper limit mass transfer rate M(max) during the decline for several assumed values of the disk inclination angle i and distance D to the source. We find that M decays exponentially with a characteristic time of approximately 43 days. The cooling front predicted by the disk instability models to occur in the outer disk when T < 10(4) K should have been observable, but was not seen.

ID aerosols
AB This work is based on simultaneous measurements of spectral direct solar radiation (using Eppley's pyrheliometer) and total mass particulate concentration (using a high-volume sampler) carried out in Katowice, Upper Silesian Industrial Region (USIR), Poland, in the period 1982-1987. Relationships between spectral aerosol optical depth values (tau(a-lambda)) expressing the solar radiation extinction and total suspended particulates concentration at near ground-level air are, in general, weak (correlation coefficient r=0.0-0.40) except after rainy (or snowy) periods in cold months [October-March (X-III)] with correlation coefficient r=0.67-0.68. In conclusion, the fundamental effect of relative humidity on variability as well as on the magnitude and range of tau(a) values in existing anthropogenic emission structure over USIR area was confirmed.

TI JET-STIRRED COMBUSTOR BEHAVIOR NEAR BLOWOUT - OBSERVATIONS AND IMPLICATIONS
SO COMBUSTION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
DE (PERFECTLY) STIRRED REACTOR; EXTINCTION (BLOWOUT); MECHANISM; STABILITY
AB The behavior of jet-stirred combustors near blowout has been examined. Such units nominally emulate perfectly stirred reactors (PSR). Previous experimental data on instantaneous temperatures and stable species from a toroidal design have suggested non-PSR behavior as overall extinction is approached. Detailed mechanistic modeling in this work shows that such combustors experience global blowout at significantly lower mass flow rates than predicted by a PSR model. It is suggested that, as overall blowout is approached, only a fraction of the physical reactor volume is under active combustion as localized extinction occurs while apparent global stability still exists. This hypothesis is used to successfully predict observed global extinction points for C2H4/air and CO/H-2/air in a toroidal unit, and CH4/air in a spherical unit. In order to judge whether a stirred combustor is experiencing significant departures from PSR behavior, a test is offered for carbon-containing fuels burned under fuel-lean conditions. It compares the measured CO concentration with the predicted CO concentration obtained from a PSR computer simulation based on an elementary CO/H-2 reaction mechanism and a modified feed composition. In this feed, the actual fuel is replaced with a stoichiometrically equivalent amount of CO and H2O, and the O2 feed is reduced accordingly. If localized instability is occuring, the measured CO level will exceed the predicted CO level. This test has been confirmed for fuel-lean C2H4 oxidation in air in a toroidal jet-stirred combustor.

AB A substantial fraction of the mass of a giant molecular cloud (GMC) in the Galaxy is confined to clumps which occupy a small fraction of the volume of the cloud. A majority of the clumps in several well-studied GMCs (Ophiuchus, Orion B, Rosette, Cepheus OB3) are not in gravitational virial equilibrium, but instead are confined by the pressure of the surrounding medium. These clumps thus violate one of "Larson's laws." Generalizing the standard virial analysis for spherical clouds to spheroidal clouds, we determine the Jeans mass and the magnetic critical mass for the clumps in these clouds. The Alfven Mach number, which is proportional to the internal velocity dispersion of the clumps divided by the Alfven velocity, is estimated to be of order unity for all the clumps. The more massive clumps, which are in gravitational virial equilibrium, are too massive to be supported by magnetic fields alone (i.e., they are magnetically supercritical). Internally generated turbulence must play a key role in supporting these clumps.

AB We have obtained UV spectra of two luminous hot stars in M31 with the Hubble Space Telescope. The stars are of late O and WN spectral type and lie on opposite sides of M31. We derive UV extinction curves for M31 which differ from both the Galaxy and the LMC. We find differences between the IS absorbers in both lines of sight in M31 and in the Galactic halo, 77" apart. The stellar wind-driven mass loss of the stars is found to be 10 times lower than in similar Galactic stars. One star appears to be an eclipsing W-R binary.

AB Primitive chondritic meteorite and chondritic porous interplanetary dust mineralogies support that chondritic dust around Post-AGB stars is mostly likely to be amorphous ferromagnesiosilica and Na,Ca-bearing aluminosilica materials, or their crystalline analogs. Using experimental evidence that under highly oxydizing conditions gamma-Fe2O3 (maghemite) and Fe3O4 display refractory behavior, I submit that very low C/O ratios, that could be unique to evolving AGB stars, induce nonequilibrium formation of ferromagnetic iron oxide grains along with chondritic dust. The oxides are preferentially fractionated from chondritic dust in the stellar magnetic field which could account for the observed extreme iron underabundance in their photosphere. A search for the 1-2.5 mum infrared absorption feature, or for diagnostic magnetite and maghemite IR absorption features, could show the validity of the model here proposed.

TI THE STRUCTURE OF NGC-4565 AT 100, 160, AND 200 MICRONS - CONTINUUM DUST EMISSION IN A QUIESCENT SB GALAXY

AB We have observed NGC 4565 at 100, 160, and 200-mu-m with the University of Chicago Far-Infrared Camera and the NASA-Kuiper Airborne Observatory. In order to study the dependence of far-infrared emission on spiral structure and star formation activity, we have compared our observations of NGC 4565, a quiescent Sb galaxy, with observations of NGC 6946, an active Sc galaxy, made by Engargiola using the same instruments. Warm dust (30 K) in a bisymmetric spiral pattern superposed on an exponential disk of cool dust (20 K) can account for the far-infrared morphology of NGC 4565. Young stars power an estimated 54% of the far-infrared luminosity from the central 24 kpc region, and we see 3-6 times more dust mass at 100 and 160-mu-m than IRAS at 60 and 100-mu-m. Whereas spiral structure is closely linked to star formation in NGC 4565, its role in NGC 6946 is more complex. In NGC 6946, warm dust emission peaks in the "fluocculent" southwest arm  region while cool dust emission peaks in the "grand design" northeast arm region. Optical and infrared data suggest that there are more embedded sources heating dust locally in the southeast arm region and more UV radiation from unobscured young stellar associations heating the cool, neutral medium in the northeast arm  region. A comparison in gas and dust of NGC 4565 with edge-on projections of NGC 6946 shows that, in both galaxies, cool dust traces H I and H-2 better than the warm dust. In NGC 6946, warm dust is nearly an order of magnitude more luminous, covers a larger areal fraction of the disk, and seems to be more closely correlated with the gas surface density than in- NGC 4565. These findings are consistent with threshold star formation models. For NGC 4565, we measure a far-infrared luminosity of 9.8 x 10(9) L.. Dust reradiates 16% of the starlight in NGC 4565, compared to 35% in NGC 6946, and far-infrared continuum spectra indicate a somewhat lower ratio of warm/cool dust luminosity in NGC 4565. Energetics suggest that as much as half of the far-infrared luminosity in NGC 4565 arises from a phase of the interstellar medium which is lower in temperature and optical depth than star-forming clouds. The 100 and 160-mu-m continuum, CO, and H I observations imply a gas/dust ratio, M(gas)/M(dust), in NGC 4565 of 500, almost a factor of 2 larger than in NGC 6946; the larger ratio is a possible indication that a greater fraction of the dust in NGC 4565 radiates mostly at wavelengths longer than 200-mu-m (T(dust) < 18 K).

TI THE AGE OF PARANA FLOOD VOLCANISM, RIFTING OF GONDWANALAND, AND THE JURASSIC-CRETACEOUS BOUNDARY

AB The Parana-Etendeka flood volcanic event produced approximately 1.5 x 10(6) cubic kilometers of volcanic rocks, ranging from basalts to rhyolites, before the separation of South America and Africa during the Cretaceous period. New 40Ar/39Ar data combined with earlier paleomagnetic results indicate that Parana flood volcanism in southern Brazil began at 133 +/- 1 million years ago and lasted less than 1 million years. The implied mean eruption rate on the order of 1.5 cubic kilometers per year is consistent with a mantle plume origin for the event and is comparable to eruption rates determined for other well-documented continental flood volcanic events. Parana flood volcanism occurred before the initiation of sea floor spreading in the South Atlantic and was probably precipitated by uplift and weakening of the lithosphere by the Tristan da Cunha plume. The Parana event postdates most current estimates for the age of the faunal mass extinction associated with the Jurassic-Cretaceous boundary.

AB We have computed an extensive grid of optically thick model planetary nebulae (PN) in order to determine the extent to which the emission-line fluxes used in the planetary nebular distance scale are affected by the stellar effective temperature and the nebular and stellar metallicity. We conclude that the nebular flux in the H-beta line is closely related to the luminosity of the central star, but that the more commonly used flux in the [O III] line at 5007 angstrom can also be calibrated to give a reliable estimate of this quantity. We also present a simple method for determining the stellar effective temperature and the luminosity, and the nebular metallicity using only the Balmer lines and the lines of [O III] in the optical. As an absolute calibration of the planetary nebular distance scale, we have derived the excitation, extinction, and metallicity-corrected cutoff in the luminosity function for the planetary nebulae in both the Small and Large Magellanic Clouds and have derived the true distance modulus to the LMC by a new hydrogen-reignition clump-fitting technique based on self-consistent helium-burning evolutionary models for the central stars. On this basis we estimate the distance to the LMC to be 47.2 +/- 3.3 kpc. Using the cutoffs in the observed luminosity functions of the Galactic Bulge PN, M31, and the Virgo Cluster, and correcting the absolute luminosities of the planetary nebulae nuclei (PNn) for both stellar age and metallicity effects, we have been able to derive relative distance modulii of these systems. We find the following true distance modulii (m - M)0; LMC 18.37 +/- 0.15, SMC 18.72 +/- 0.15, Galactic Center 14.4 +/- 0.2, M31 24.14 +/- 0.20 and Virgo Cluster 30.86 +/- 0.25. In all cases where Cepheid distances are known, we find a +0.14 mag zero-point offset with respect of the PN cosmic distance scale. Correcting to the Cepheid scale, we infer that Virgo lies at a distance of 15.8 +/- 1.8 Mpc, which would imply a global Hubble constant of 84 +/- 11 km s-1 Mpc-1. We conclude that the principle uncertainty in the PN cosmic distance scale is in our knowledge of the intrinsic upper luminosity cutoff of the PN central stars, which is critically dependent upon the stellar age, and the treatment of mass loss in the stellar evolutionary models.

AB Spectroscopy of the moderately fast nova V443 Sct is presented, based on data obtained at the Vainu Bappu Observatory and at the European Southern Observatory. Observations were made during the brightness fluctuations following maximum, and during the transition stage. A few broadband polarimetric observations are also given. The spectrum and its evolution are similar to novae with the same type of light curves. The extinction E(B-V) = 0.4 is derived from ratios of higher members of the hydrogen Balmer and Paschen series, a distance of 8.0 kpc is estimated from magnitude-decay time relations. Balmer line fluxes at late stages are used to derive the mass of the ejected ionized shell, approximately 3.5 . 10(-5) M.. The variation of line flux is compatible with a homogeneous, completely filled shell whose density declines with time as N(e) is-proportional-to t(d)-2 cm-3, where t(d) is the time in days since maximum, and whose temperature rises from 6000 to 17000 K in the 272 days following outburst. On day 77, the ionizing source had a size of approximately 1 R. and a temperature of 9 x 10(4) K. During the nebular phase, the size decreased to approximately 0.5 R. and the temperature rose to approximately 2 x 10(5) K, while the luminosity appears to have remained constant for the first 236 days after outburst.

AB Interstellar dust in the Magellanic Clouds, with a weak or nearly absent 2175 angstrom extinction feature, may be of interest in studies of galaxies in early stages of chemical evolution. To this inquiry, we extend the graphite-silicate grain model, introduced by Mathis, Rumpl, & Nordsieck and developed by Draine & Lee, from the Milky Way to the Magellanic Clouds. We find that the empirical extinction curves in the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds can be reproduced by adjusting only the relative abundances of graphite and silicate grains, while leaving all other model properties fixed to those appropriate for the Galactic extinction curve. Using the graphite-silicate models, we calculate the absorption and scattering optical depths, the mass-density ratio of interstellar dust to neutral hydrogen, and the Kramers-Kronig relation for all three galaxies. We also present a fitting function for the three extinction curves, valid not only over the observed range of wavelengths but also over the full range as predicted by the models. All the quantities we derived here are independent of the dust-to-gas ratios in the Milky Way and the Magellanic Clouds, and can be applied to other galaxies if they contain Galactic or Magellanic-type dust.

AB A resolution of the long-standing CH+ problem almost certainly will yield considerable insight into processes (e.g. mass and energy transfer at interfaces between plasma in different phases) affecting a wide range of astrophysical environments.  CH+ column densities are large (greater-than-or-equal-to 10(12) cm-2) along at least three types of lines of sight:  (i) those with little molecular hydrogen; (ii) those passing through diffuse molecular clouds such as zeta Oph, and (iii) those that provide high reddening of the background stars (visual extinctions of about 2-4 mag).  This indicates either that one process of ubiquitous importance is responsible for the CH+ production or that that a number of different scenarios must be considered.  In this paper we explore the latter view. For type (i) we have investigated the production of interstellar CH+ by the destruction, in shocks, of hydrogenated amorphous carbon in grains and the subsequent photoabsorption sequence.  We argue that much of the eroded carbon passes through CH+.  Maximum column densities (congruent-to 10(12) cm-2) of CH+ are obtained in the absence of H-2. For type (ii), we have calculated the relative abundances of CH+, CH, OH, and various upsilon = 0 rotationally excited levels of H-2 in hot diffuse molecular gas in which the velocity distributions are all Maxwellian.  We argue that such gas exists in turbulent boundary layers at molecular-cloud-intercloud interfaces and has speeds lower than those associated with shocks, which have been advocated as the sources of hot gas containing CH+.  We demonstrate that plausible conditions can be adopted which lead to relative abundances of several important species close to those observed.  The presence of components of CH associated with CH+ in warm interfaces places fairly stringent constraints on the pressures in the interfaces. For type (iii) we show that CH+ column densities of 10(14) cm-2 can be produced in photon-dominated regions only if the conditions in them are similar to those under which hydroxyl maser regions, surrounding young stars, form.  A more likely alternative is that a CH+ column density of 10(14) cm-2 towards a highly reddened star arises in one thick boundary layer or several boundary layers like those considered for type (ii).

TI THE ORIGIN OF THE FAR-INFRARED LUMINOSITY WITHIN THE SPIRAL GALAXY-M51

AB High resolution, approximately 50", measurements of the 170-mu-m and H-alpha luminosity have been compared at 36 locations within the spiral galaxy M51 in order to elucidate the origin of the far-infrared luminosity. After correcting the H-alpha luminosity for extinction and extrapolating the 170-mu-m luminosity to a 40-1000-mu-m far-infrared luminosity we find that the far-infrared luminosity is comparable to that expected from the O and B stars which are required to ionize the hydrogen gas. The results show that the far-infrared luminosity is in quantitative agreement with that expected from O and B stars at all locations within M51. Furthermore, IRAS HiRes 60 and 100-mu-m images of M51 indicate that the temperature of the dust responsible for the far-infrared luminosity is similar to that expected for dust in the vicinity of H II regions over the entire star forming disk of M51. The mass of dust required to radiate the 60 and 100-mu-m emission, measured for M51 by IRAS, is about a factor of 10 lower than the dust content of M51 estimated from the atomic and molecular gas masses and a Galactic gas/dust mass ratio. The most plausible explanation for the discrepancy is that the majority (approximately 90%) of the dust within M51 is radiating at wavelengths longward of 100-mu-m, and must therefore be cooler than the approximately 33 K dust that dominates the emission measured by IRAS. The 170-mu-m measurement of M51, obtained by Smith [ApJ, 261, 463 (1982)], provides independent support for large quantities of cold dust as the 170-mu-m flux is significantly higher than would be expected if all the dust were radiating at the same temperature as that measured by IRAS. The high gas/warm dust mass ratio is used to constrain the mass of dust that radiates at wavelengths longward of 100-mu-m, and the 60, 100, and 170-mu-m photometry is used to constrain the temperature of the dust. The constraints require the bulk, approximately 90%, of the dust mass within M51 to be cold with a temperature less-than-or-equal-to 16 K. Molecular gas dominates the interstellar medium within M51 and the temperature derived for the dust is consistent with that expected for dust in molecular clouds. The far-infrared luminosity of M51 is dominated by thermal emission from warm, approximately 33 K, dust even though most (approximately 90%) of the dust mass within M51 is much colder with a temperature of approximately 16 K. The ability for a small mass of warm dust to dominate the luminosity of significantly greater quantities of colder dust arises as a natural consequence of the strong temperature dependence of thermal emission.

AB Facies, faunal and geochemical evidence from the Permian/Triassic boundary sediments of the Dolomites and Idaho indicates a major anoxic event in the earliest Triassic. In both regions, the basal beds consist of finely laminated micrites with common syngenetic pyrite. The only fauna consists of occasional bedding plane assemblages of Lingula or Claraia, a typical lower dysaerobic assemblage. This is a level where previous studies have shown a major negative carbon isotope excursion and a cerium anomaly. In the Dolomites, the pyritic micrite directly overlies strata containing a diverse and typically Permian marine fauna of algae, foraminifers (including fusulinids) and articulate brachiopods, implying an abrupt extinction in contradiction to many previous views. Sequence stratigraphic analysis of the Dolomite boundary sediments reveals a minor sequence boundary in the late Permian followed by extremely rapid transgression leading to the development of the relatively deep water pyritic micrite - a maximum flooding surface at the Permo-Triassic boundary. A further pulsed deepening in the lower Griesbachian, recorded in both the Dolomites and Idaho, lead to the widespread establishment of dysaerobic facies. It is clear that most of the extinctions occurred at the erathem boundary although the subsequent failure of the marine benthos to fill the empty ecospace in the ensuing Griesbachian may have been due to the widespread development of dysaerobic conditions.

AB Five single SiC grains, 2-9-mu-m in size, from the Murchison carbonaceous meteorite have been analyzed by ion microprobe mass spectrometry for their C, N, Si, Mg-Al, Ca, and Ti isotopic compositions. While most interstellar SiC grains from primitive meteorites are characterized by C-13, N-14, Si-29, Si-30, Ti-46, Ti-47, Ti-49, and Ti-50 excesses relative to solar isotopic ratios, and Al-26/Al-27 ratios of up to approximately 10(-2), carrying the signatures of H- and He-burning, these five grains (=grains X) have large excesses in C-12 (up to 28 times solar) and N-15 (up to 22 times solar), depletion in Si-29 and Si-30 (up to 59%), and Al-26/Al-27 ratios between 0.1 and 0.6. They furthermore have Ti-49 excesses (up to 95%), and one grain has a large Ca-44 excess (300%). While the Ca and Ti anomalies point toward explosive nucleosynthesis in supernovae and the in situ decay of the radioactive precursors Ti-44 and V-49 in SiC grains formed in supernova ejecta, there is no simple formation scenario that can give a consistent explanation for the isotopic compositions of these grains.

AB We have mapped the Bok globule Orion-I-2 in the lines of (CO)-C-12, (CO)-C-13, (CO)-O-18, CS, and HCN with the IRAM 30-m radio telescope. These high angular resolution observations reveal a bipolar outflow extending over 40" (almost-equal-to 2 10(4) AU) associated with an IRAS point source of L(FIR) almost-equal-to 12L.. Therefore, our observations show that low-mass star formation can take place in isolated and small Bok globules. The mean gas density, from the (CO)-C-13 and (CO)-O-18 emission, is almost-equal-to 2 10(4) cm-3, and the peak density, from CS J = 2 --> 1 and J = 3 --> 2 line intensities. is almost-equal-to 2 10(5) cm-3. The derived visual extinction towards the globule center is 20 mag. The gas temperature derived from the (CO)-C-12 line intensities is almost-equal-to 25 K. The globule's core mass is 4M. and represents an important fraction of the total globule's mass. The mass of the outflowing gas is 0.15M.. The total mass of the globule is almost-equal-to 14M.. CCD H-alpha, I, R, and S II images show the globule's bright limb to be a diffuse H II region, not a reflection nebula. That implies the external layers of Ori-I-2 are being evaporated by the local UV radiation field, which perhaps has affected the course of the star-forming history of the globule. We present a simple model that explains the observed properties of the molecular emission. The velocity field of the globule, which appears to be collapsing or imploding, has a natural explanation in this framework.

AB Optical properties of dust aggregates of astrophysical interest have been investigated by means of the discrete dipole approximation (DDA) to clarify how differences in structure, size and chemical composition of dust aggregates affect their optical properties. Two types of dust aggregates have been treated; one is the Ballistic Particle-Cluster Aggregates (BPCA) whose fractal dimension D approximately 3, and the other is the Ballistic Cluster-Cluster Aggregates (BCCA) for which D approximately 2. Two kinds of minerals have been considered for the constituent particles; silicate and magnetite. The results of the calculations show that the optical properties of dust aggregates are divided into two regimes according to their characteristic size a(c); in the wavelength range lambda much greater than lambda(c) = 2pia(c), the optical properties are qualitatively reproduced by the Rayleigh approximation for a sphere with the same mass and do not depend on the structure of the dust aggregates. The scattering cross sections start to deviate from the Rayleigh regime at about the characteristic wavelength lambda(c) = 2pia(c), which is a diagnostic for the sizes of dust aggregates, irrespective of the chemical composition of the constituent particles. The wavelength dependence of the absorption cross sections can be interpreted in terms of the optical thickness of the dust aggregates themselves and can be approximated with a simple formula. This formula is useful to determine the dependence of the temperature of dust aggregates in space on their sizes as well as structures, which plays a crucial role in considering the physical and chemical evolution of dust aggregates in space. The wavelength dependence of the asymmetry parameter reflects the size as well as the structure of dust aggregates, independent of the chemical composition of the constituent particles. BPCA are characterized by an enhanced forward scattering in the region of lambda much less than lambda(c) in comparison with BCCA with the same mass, in spite of the smaller size of BPCA. The applicability of the Maxwell-Garnett mixing rule to dust aggregates is investigated in comparison with the results of the calculations using the discrete dipole approximation.

AB We present time-resolved International Ultraviolet Explorer observations of the low-mass X-ray binary AC211/4U2127 + 11 in the globular cluster M15 (NGC 7078). The spectra show He II 1640-angstrom emission, the flux of which is modulated on the 8.5-hr orbital period of AC211. This modulation, and the ratio of He II 1640 angstrom to He II 4686 angstrom and C IV 1550 angstrom imply that the He II lines originate in an accretion disc corona. In addition there are absorption lines typical of hot stars, but it is unclear whether they originate in AC211, or surrounding horizontal branch stars. Finally, we compare the reddening derived from the 2200-angstrom feature in our spectra with earlier determinations.

AB A method has been developed for the analysis of derivatized diradylglycerols obtained from glycerophosphocholine (GPC) of transformed murine bone marrow-derived mast cells that provided high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) separation of GPC subclasses and molecular species separation with on-line quantitation using UV detection.  In addition, the derivatized diradylglycerol species were unequivocably identified by continuous flow fast-atom bombardment mass spectrometry.  GPC was initally isolated by thin-layer chromatography (TLC), the phosphocholine group was hydrolyzed, and the resultant diradylglycerol was derivatized with 7-[(chlorocarbonyl)-methoxy]-4-methylcoumarin (CMMC).  After separation of the derivatized subclasses by normal phase HPLC, the individual molecular species of the alkylacyl and diacyl subclasses were quantitated and collected during a subsequent reverse phase HPLC step.  With an extinction coefficient of 14,700 l mol-1 cm-1 at a wavelength detection of 320 nm, the CMMC derivatives afforded sensitive UV detection (100 pmol) and quantitation of the molecular species.  Continuous flow fast-atom bombardment mass spectrometry of the alkylacyl CMMC derivatives yielded abundant [MH]+ ions and a single fragment ion formed by loss of alkylketene from the sn-2 acyl group, [MH-(R = C = O)]+.  No fragmentation of the sn-1 alkyl chain was observed.  Diacyl derivatives also produced abundant [MH]+ ions plus two fragment ions arising from loss of RCOOH from each of the acyl substituents and two fragment ions from the loss of alkylketene from each acyl group.  Individual molecular species substituents were assigned from these ions.

AB Solar and sky radiation measurements were analyzed to obtain aerosol properties such as the optical thickness and the size distribution. The measurements were conducted as part of the First International Satellite Land Surface Climatology Project (ISLSCP) Field Experiment (FIFE) during the second intensive field campaign (IFC) from June 25 to July 14, 1987, and the fifth IFC from July 25 to August 12, 1989, on the Konza Prairie near Manhattan, Kansas. Correlations with climatological and meteorological parameters show that during the period of observations in 1987, two types of air masses dominated the area: an air mass with low optical thickness and low temperature air associated with a northerly breeze, commonly referred to as the continental air, and an air mass with a higher optical thickness and higher temperature air associated with a southerly wind which we call "Gulf air." The size distributions show a predominance of the larger size particles in Gulf air. Because of the presence of two contrasting air masses, correlations with parameters such as relative humidity, specific humidity, pressure, temperature, and North Star sky radiance reveal some interesting aspects. In 1989, clear distinctions between continental and Gulf air cannot be made; the reason for this will be discussed.

AB SAGE II multiwavelength aerosol extinction measurements are used to estimate mass- and extinction-to-backscatter conversion parameters. The basis of the analysis is the principal component analysis of the SAGE II extinction kernels to estimate both total aerosol mass and aerosol backscatter at a variety of wavelengths. Comparisons of coincident SAGE II extinction profiles with 0.694-mu-m aerosol backscatter profiles demonstrate the validity of the method.

AB We present a new, independent survey of the infrared emission for 161 Galactic supernova remnants using Skyflux image data from the Infrared Astronomical Satellite. We have derived new kinematic distances for 11 of the 44 positively or possibly identified remnants, using a new Galactic rotation curve with current IAU constants, R0 = 8.5 kpc and V0 = 220 km s-1. This new survey, which both complements and improves on the results of previous surveys, indicates that the infrared region is the equal of other spectral regimes for remnant detection. We used temperature-sensitive flux ratio images to help identify and define remnant emission structures and fluxes, particularly in complex regions. Of the 161 remnants examined, we found clear infrared emission from 35, with nine additional possible detections. Our detection rate is highest toward the Galactic anticenter, where source confusion is less severe. By fitting the observed fluxes to a two-temperature dust model with lambda--1.5 grain emissivities, we provide color-corrected fluxes in the four IRAS bands for every identified source. Planck-averaged grain opacities then yield remnant luminosities and dust mass estimates. Almost all young remnants (Tycho, Kepler, Cas A, Crab) have a significant 12 and 25-mu-m flux, while older remnants are brightest at 60 and 100-mu-m. With remnant radius as an age estimator, correlations with mass and temperature indicate that older remnants are both colder and more massive, as expected from decreasing shock velocity. No radius-luminosity correlation is seen. Good agreement generally exists between a remnant's nonthermal radio emission and its IR emission structure. Since a young remnant's dust is heated primarily by electron collisions in high-temperature plasmas, even better agreement can be seen between a remnant's IR and X-ray structure (e.g., the Cygnus Loop). However, the key advantage of far-IR observations is their ability to detect massive, slowly expanding, dusty shells, which often are weak in optical or nonthermal radio emissions. The main disadvantage of far-IR imaging is the moderate-to-severe source confusion in or near the Galactic plane owing to negligible interstellar extinction.

TI PERMIAN AND EARLY TRIASSIC EXTINCTION OF NONMARINE TETRAPODS
SO PALAEONTOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
ID mass extinction; fossil record
AB The non-marine tetrapods of the Permian and Early Triassic experienced four significant episodes of extinction during a time of relatively high turnover at the family level. The Artinskian, Ufimian, and Scythian extinctions appear genuine, but the Tatarian extinction is compromised by spurious data. The quality of the Tatarian data is considered in the light of the poor stratigraphical record for the Late Permian and Permian-Triassic boundary. Various extinction mechanisms are considered, bearing in mind that the radiation of the mammal-like reptiles forms a large portion of the diversity data. The most likely hypothesis is that non-marine tetrapods were subjected to environmental stress as climates fluctuated, at first in association with glaciation, and then with continental warming.

AB IRAS far-infrared fluxes are presented for six H II regions in the Large Magellanic Cloud. These regions are the sites of recent, massive star formation where the radiative heating source is young stars rather than the general interstellar radiation field. As such, the observations become building blocks for the interpretation of far-infrared emission from spatially unresolved galaxies. In addition, the multiwavelength luminosities of the region then probe the young stellar upper initial mass function. With the long-range goal of determining the stellar content of unresolved star-forming regions, we present the results of a simple model which combines the infrared data with existing Halpha/Hbeta and thermal radio data. For the two OB associations where the mass function has been determined directly, the model correctly "predicts" a solar neighborhood upper mass function within the uncertainties. No evidence is found for upper mass functions significantly different from that in the solar neighborhood.

TI STABLE ISOTOPE AND FORAMINIFERAL CHANGES ACROSS THE CRETACEOUS TERTIARY BOUNDARY AT STEVNS-KLINT, DENMARK - ARGUMENTS FOR LONG-TERM OCEANIC INSTABILITY BEFORE AND AFTER BOLIDE-IMPACT EVENT

AB Stable isotope and planktic and benthic foraminiferal analyses of the K/T boundary transition at Stevns Klint, Denmark, indicate a 100-500 kyr long period of instability in oceanic bottom-water temperature and sea level. During the latest Maastrichtian (from 2.7 m below and up to the K/T boundary) bottom-water temperatures gradually cooled about 1.5-degrees-C as surface water temperatures remained constant. At the K/T boundary bottom water temperatures decreased additionally 3-degrees-C, and then returned to pre-boundary values just above the boundary interval. Coincident with the onset of the first temperature decrease there was a prominent sea-level fall, estimated between 50-100 m as observed in benthic and planktic foraminiferal assemblages as well as in a decreasing surface-to-bottom delta-C-13 gradient. About 40 cm below the iridium-rich K/T boundary clay, sea level began to rise. Poor preservation of foraminifera above the K/T boundary allows only tentative interpretation of Danian events at Stevns Klint, however, sea level generally continued to rise interrupted by short sea level falls. Associated with the observed sea-level changes are three important hiatuses: At the contact between the white chalk and overlying grey-white bryozoan chalk about 2.7 m below the K/T boundary, at or near the top of the Fish Clay (Zone P1a, Parvularugoglobigerina eugubina missing) and at the contact of the Cerithium Limestone and overlying Bryozoan Limestone about 60 cm above the K/T boundary (part of Zone P1c missing). These unconformities are coeval with hiatuses observed in many continental shelf sections and indicate a global eustatic rather than regional isostatic response. Notable is that at Stevns Klint the episode of oceanic instability is registered over approximately the same stratigraphic interval in which supposed extraterrestrial amino acids occur, a circumstance that may indicate a connection. A gradual positive shift in delta-C-13 is registered in both benthic and planktic foraminiferal assemblages in the upper Maastrichtian at Stevns Klint. The positive shift is followed by a prominent negative delta-C-13 shift (1.3 parts per thousand) at the K/T boundary. An upper Maastrichtian positive delta-C-13 excursion followed by a negative delta-C-13 anomaly at or near the K/T boundary has previously been observed in deep-sea cores from the Pacific Ocean and the Weddell Sea, Antarctica, implying a global event. Previous suggestions of a relation between the uppermost Maastrichtian positive delta-C-13 excursion and sea-level variation are not supported by the data for Stevns Klint.

AB We have developed a general radiative transfer code for the continuum radiation to compute the incident radiation field inside a non-homogeneous, spherically symmetric cloud. We have included a dust emission model which takes into account IR emission by transiently heated small dust particles. The model has been applied to compute the emission at IR-submm wavelengths for a set of clouds of various extinction and density distributions, containing a dust composition similar to that of the diffuse interstellar medium. Although the model is not restricted to the hypothesis adopted in this paper, we assumed that the clouds are heated only by the diffuse interstellar radiation field. We give, for a wide range of density distributions and total mass, the global emission of the cloud from IR to Submm wavelengths. We also present and discuss the spatial and spectral distribution of this emission and the characteristics of the radiation field through the cloud. At IRAS wavelengths, we find that the Limb Brightening (LB) is expected to appear in all the IRAS bands if the total extinctions toward the cloud center exceeds 4-10 mag. IRAS color as 12/100 or 25/100 are predicted to decrease continuously from the edge to the center of the cloud for constant dust composition into the cloud. Comparison of these results with the IRAS data suggest that the actual color variations can only be explained by variations of dust abundance rather than by radiative transfer effects. This implies that halos with an increased abundance of small dust particles must be present around clouds showing limb brightening at short IRAS wavelengths. Possible influences of halos on the equilibrium temperature of small and bigger dust grains in dense clouds and on the associated FIR-Submm cloud emission is also investigated. The 100 mum surface brightness is predicted to be proportional to the total column density only in the outer regions of the clouds but it can be used to estimate column densities up to extinctions of 5 - 10 mag if the inhomogeneities in the cloud envelope emitting most of the 100 mum radiation are small enough. For higher extinctions (A(V) > 10 mag), the model predicts a significant LB at 100 mum which we attribute to the decrease of the temperature and emission of the bigger grains inside the cloud. As a consequence, the 100 mum surface brightness is limited to congruent-to 20 MJy/sr for any model, independent of column density. In the FIR-Submm, the LB effect progressively disappear and the global emission of the cloud becomes progressively proportional to its mass.

AB We address whether isotopically anomalous SiC particles found in meteorites originate in AGB stars. We show that if the peak helium shell flash temperatures of massive (6-9 M.) AGB stars are about 10% larger than they are normally assumed to be, alpha particle reactions with the magnesium will become significant. Then the Mg-26(alpha, n)Si-29 reaction produces a large excess of Si-29. With a light element nuclear reaction network, we calculate the evolution of the silicon isotopic composition during AGB evolution and find that the experimentally determined (slope = 1.4) correlation between excess Si-29 and excess Si-30 in SiC particles from carbonaceous chondrites can indeed be naturally produced in this way. This demonstration contrasts with previous negative conclusions for temperatures too low for magnesium burning to contribute. We are therefore led to suggest that if the large isotopically anomalous SiC particles carrying nearly pure s-process krypton and xenon do indeed originate in AGB stars, those stars were massive and have peak shell flash temperatures near 450 MK. We also demonstrate that this suggestion may answer some interesting questions related to the sizes of the meteoritic SiC particles.

AB We report 1.25-19.5 mum infrared photometry and optical/infrared spectroscopy of Nova QV Vul (1987) from 1987 November through 1989 September. The measurements show that an optically thick carbon dust shell formed within 83 days of the outburst, and that the spectral signatures of four types of astrophysical grains appeared at various times during a 2 year period following the eruption. Carbon, SiC, and hydrocarbons formed first; oxygen-rich silicates formed later. The ejecta in which the optically thick carbon grain shell condensed were apparently moving at nearly 3 times the velocity of the principle ejecta responsible for the early emission from the hot gas pseudophotosphere. We suggest the possibility that the carbon dust components formed in fast-moving polar plumes, and that the silicates formed in a slow-moving equatorial ring. Mass estimates from the infrared photometry and optical spectroscopy confirm that grain condensation in both the slow and fast ejecta of QV Vul is consistent with constraints established by previous observations of other dusty novae. The physical properties of the dust condensation zones are discussed, and numerical estimates of the dust mass are given for carbon and silicates. We conclude that the condensible elements in these grains were present in approximately solar abundance.

TI MASS-LOSS FROM OH/IR STARS - MODELS FOR THE INFRARED-EMISSION OF CIRCUMSTELLAR DUST SHELLS

AB We have modeled the infrared emission of a sample of 24 OH/IR stars deriving the properties of circumstellar dust and mass-loss rate of the central star. Our results show that for some sources the observations of the far-infrared emission is well fitted with a lambda--1 law, while some have a steeper index of 1.5. At 60-mu-m, this corresponds to kappa-60 of 240 and 160 cm2 g-1 for the former and latter, respectively. For a few sources, detailed studies of the observed 10-mu-m feature suggest the presence of circumstellar ice grains. Dust mass-loss rates have been determined from detailed studies for all the stars in this sample. They range from 6.0 x 10(-10) M. yr-1 for an optically visible Mira to 2.2 x 10(-6) M. yr-1 for a heavily obscured OH/IR star. These dust mass-loss rates are then compared to those calculated from IRAS photometry using 12, 25, and 60-mu-m fluxes. The dust mass-loss rates are also compared to gas mass-loss rates determined from OH and CO observations. For stars with tenuous shells, a dust-to-gas ratio of 0.001 is obtained. For heavily obscured stars, however, both OH and CO seem to underestimate the mass-loss rate considerably. This may be due to a recent (< 10(2) yr) enhancement in mass-loss rates.

AB The Cretaceous/Tertiary (K/T) and Permian/Triassic (P/Tr) events differ in many more aspects than they are similar. This alone makes it unlikely that they are parts of a common web of periodic mass extinction events (MEE). Unlike the K/T, most MEE have no Ir anomalies, and where (in the comparatively complete section of the P/Tr at Gartnerkofel, Austria) weak Ir concentrations are found, their ratios to siderophile elements (Co, Ni, Cr) are far less than chondritic. In contrast, ratios to chalcophile elements (As, Sb, Zn) never approach chondritic, even in K/T peaks, and locality differences suggest local depositional processes that may also affect the siderophiles. Profiles of isotopes (delta-C-13carb, Sr-87/Sr-86, and possibly delta-O-18carb) across these boundaries also differ radically. Whereas the K/T profile of surface ocean delta-C-13carb has been shown to be mainly a drop in primary productivity, the P/Tr profile is interpreted at least in part to be a consequence of a large and accelerating oxidation of previously stored C(org), with greatly differing consequences for climate. These and other differences of proximate forcings for these two MEE lead us to a hypothesis that such external exigencies were ever (intermittently and severally) with us, but were effective only when the biotic web had already internally unravelled in some crucially strained patch. Gaia became Antigaia!

TI MASS EXTINCTIONS AS STATISTICAL PHENOMENA - AN EXAMINATION OF THE EVIDENCE USING CHI-2 TESTS AND BOOTSTRAPPING

ID fossil record; periodicity; patterns; diversity; family; genera; rates
AB Although much natural historical evidence has been adduced in support of the occurrence of several mass extinctions during the Phanerozoic, unambiguous statistical confirmation of the mass extinction phenomenon has remained elusive. Using bootstrapping techniques that have not previously been applied to the study of mass extinction, we have amassed strong or very strong statistical evidence for mass extinctions (see text for definitions) during the Late Ordovician, Late Permian, and Late Cretaceous. Bootstrapping therefore verifies three of the mass extinction events that were proposed by Raup and Sepkoski (1982). A small amount of bootstrapping evidence is also presented for mass extinctions in the Induan (Triassic) and Coniacean (Cretaceous) Stages, but high overall turnover rates (including high origination) in the Induan and uncertain estimates of the temporal duration of the Coniacean force us to conclude that the evidence is not compelling. We also present the results of more liberal chi-2 tests of the differences between expected and observed numbers of familial extinctions for stratigraphic stages. In addition to verifying the mass extinctions identified using bootstrapping, these analyses suggest that several stages that could not be verified as mass extinction stages using bootstrapping (including the last three in the Devonian, and the Norian Stage of the Triassic) should still be regarded as candidates for mass extinction. Further analysis will be required to test these stages in more detail.

AB Dense populations of epifaunal, suspension-feeding ophiuroids, or brittlestar beds, are widely distributed geographically, but they are rare and are restricted in their habitat distribution. On a microecological scale (meters to kilometers, hours to days), experimental studies and censuses of sublethal injury show the distribution of brittlestar beds in the British Isles and the Bahamas to be limited by predatory fishes and crabs. On an ecological scale (tens to hundreds of km, decades to centuries), there is evidence that predation by seastars limits the distribution of brittlestar beds in the English Channel, beyond the stringent restrictions imposed by fish and crab predators in modern ecosystems. On an evolutionary scale (globally, millions to tens of millions of years), the Mesozoic decline of brittle-star beds visible in the fossil record is associated with the diversification of predators adapted to eat skeletonized prey, including teleostean fishes, neoselachian sharks, and decapod crustaceans. In this biological interaction, microecological- and ecological-scale processes are reflected in evolutionary-scale patterns. The scale-independent effects of predation on brittlestar beds, and other scale-independent biological interactions, may be related to self-organized criticality, d consequence of the non-linear dynamics of the biosphere.

AB The nonsteady behaviour of counterflow diffusion hydrogen-air flames is studied in this article, using a finite difference implicit method and a complex kinetics model. The flame responses to step and sinusoidal strain rate variations are obtained for flames submitted to moderate strain rates and also to strain rates corresponding to extinction conditions. Frequency response curves are obtained for both cases and for different values of the equivalence ratio. The behaviour of flame characteristics like the maximum temperature, the heat release rate and typical species mass fraction profiles is examined. It is found that H2O and OH radicals change approximately like the maximum temperature while hydrogen atom H mass fraction exhibits larger excursion. The dynamics of the flame are governed by the imposed mean strain rate on one hand and by the critical extinction strain rate on the other. Far from the extinction limit the cut-off frequency is set by the mean strain rate and the flame behaviour is essentially linear. Close to the extinction limit the flame behaves non-linearly. It may be extinguished at low frequencies when the instantaneous strain rate exceeds the critical extinction value by a sufficient amount and for a sufficiently long period of time.

AB Results of high- and low-resolution spectral and UBV photometric observations of MWC 560 during 1990 January-October are presented in this paper. Strong variations in the star brightness compared with previously published observations are discussed. The presence of flickering activity from the U-band monitoring observations is also noted. The most remarkable features in the spectra obtained during 1990 January-April are the strong violet-shifted Balmer absorption components with velocities of up to approximately -6000 km s-1 visible up to about H20-H21. The Balmer emission components are relatively weak and are easily visible only up to H-delta-H-epsilon. Numerous emission lines, mainly of the ionized metals, are present as well. The observations in 1990 October showed dramatic changes in comparison with those from the beginning of the year. The U-B colour reddened by about 0.5 mag but at the same time V and B-V remained almost constant. The first members of the Balmer series have P Cygni profiles, and the absorption components show violet shifts of only a few hundred km s-1. Some of the strongest lines of Fe II and Ti II show similar profiles as well. A rough estimation of approximately 1 kpc for the distance to MWC 560 is obtained. Assuming MWC 560 to be a binary system consisting of an M4.5 giant and a white dwarf (probably magnetic), we briefly discuss its nature. We suppose that there are two different types of activity shown by MWC 560: first discrete jet ejections during 1990 January-April with high velocities, and secondly quasi-stationary ejections with relatively low velocities at least from 1990 September and later.

DT Article; Proceedings Paper
AB In many industrial processes both heterogeneous and homogeneous reactions can occur, and these reactions are strongly coupled through heat and mass transfer and reactive intermediates. Surface reactions can heat the boundary layer sufficiently to ignite homogeneous reaction, can deplete the boundary layer of a limiting reactant, and can act as a source or sink of free radicals. We have studied combustion reactions over catalytic foils and in catalytic monoliths for simple oxidations such as CH4 + O2, NH3 + O2, C3H8 + O2, CH4 + NO and NH3 + NO. For most reactions and geometries, we observe heterogeneous and homogeneous ignitions and extinctions and self-sustaining autothermal steady states. The range of compositions for which an autothermal state exists depends sensitively on the inlet gas velocity. For stagnation point flow, reaction over a catalytic foil can be modeled by a one-dimensional boundary value problem in which saddle-node bifurcations correspond to ignitions and extinctions. Computations for a model with simplified kinetics reproduce the experimental dependence on input power to the foil and inlet gas composition. Calculations also show that the dynamics are affected strongly by the inlet gas velocity.

AB We demonstrate the first transverse magnetic (TM) pass waveguide polarizer suitable for integrated optic or fiber optic geometries. The polarizing properties of waveguides incorporating an ultrathin discontinuous silver film are due to excitation of a localized surface plasmon mode. The polarizers have a large bandwidth ( > 100 nm), high extinction ratios, and do not rely on sensitive phase matching conditions. We illustrate these novel polarizing properties on ion-exchanged planar waveguides overlayed with a 5-nm-mass thick silver film. The measured extinction ratio was 35 dB/mm at 836 nm with 2 dB/mm loss for the TM polarization. The theoretical analysis of the film properties and waveguide propagation losses is compared with the experiments.

AB Strong emission in the (CO)-C-12 J = 1-0 and 2-1 lines is reported from the lenticular galaxy NGC 3593. A deconvolution of the data to a nominal angular resolution of 8" (corresponding to 270 pc at d = 7 Mpc) shows that the molecular gas is distributed in a ring-like configuration of radius 200-350pc, located at the turning point of the rotation curve. The kinematical center and the center of the molecular ring, as well as the center of the radio continuum emission, are offset approximately 15" from the optical center position. This difference is most likely caused by extinction at optical wavelengths. The diameter of the J = 1-0 ring is larger than both the 2-1 ring and the angular separation between the peaks of the radio continuum emission, suggesting either the presence of optically thin CO near the inner boundary of the ring, a radial gradient in density or in kinetic temperature with the highest values near the center. The total molecular masses derived from the far infrared flux and the (CO(1-0))-C-12 integrated intensity, approximately 3 10(8) M. and approximately 4.5 10(8) M., indicate that dust and molecular cloud properties do not differ drastically from those in the Milky Way. The M(H-2)/M(tot) ratio is 1% for the entire galaxy and 8% inside a radius of 10" (350pc). The M(H-2)/M(HI) ratio is approximately 2.5. Toward the central region, (CO(2-1))-C-13 data infer an optical depth of 0.2. The beam averaged (CO)-C-13 column density is of order 7 10(15) cm-2 and the beam filling factor less than or similar 0.1. This is the first time that the three-dimensional 'Lucy rectification' has been applied to analyse the detailed spatial morphology and velocity distribution of extragalactic molecular gas. An alternative approach, 'Simulated Annealing', is also tested for one- and three-dimensional applications, yielding consistent results with respect to the velocity field and the emissivity distribution of NGC 3593.

AB In a radio and optical program aimed at identifying gravitational lens candidates, we have discovered that the strong radio source, MG0414 + 0534, displays many of the properties expected in a gravitational lens system. At radio wavelengths and 0.5" resolution, MG0414 + 0534 is made up of four compact components whose unusual configuration and relative flux densities are similar to those found in confirmed four-image gravitational lens systems. At optical wavelengths (with less than or similar 1" seeing) we detect three objects, consistent with there being optical objects at the positions of the radio components, given the lower optical resolution. The radio and optical centroid positions agree within the astrometric errors, and the relative ordering of the fluxes is the same. The colors and radio-optical spectral indices are similar, but there are differences larger than the photometric errors and the measured variability (approximately 30%). The optical properties of the objects are unusual, and do not fit any conventional active galactic nucleus classification scheme. All three optical objects are exceedingly red, with R-I instrumental colors about 1.5 magnitudes redder than a nearby M star. A spectrum, in the wavelength range 4333-9793 angstrom, of the combined light of the two brighter objects displays a power law continuum, with spectral index alpha = 9 (f(nu) is-proportional-to nu(-alpha)) . There are no emission lines, and only one securely detected broad absorption line; therefore, the redshifts of the objects are as yet unknown. There is, as yet, no convincing evidence for light from a lensing galaxy or galaxies. If MG0414 + 0534 is a gravitational lens, this implies either a large lens mass-to-light ratio, a large source redshift, or the presence of significant extinction. Extinction by dust might simultaneously explain the unusually red color and the absence of light from a lens. Since the galactic latitude of MG0414 + 0534 is - 31-degrees, such dust is unlikely to be found along the line of sight within the Galaxy.

TI SHOCKED QUARTZ AT THE TRIASSIC-JURASSIC BOUNDARY IN ITALY
SO SCIENCE
LA English
DT Article
ID cretaceous-tertiary boundary; mass extinctions; fossil record; event
AB Quartz grains that appear to have been shock-metamorphosed occur within three closely spaced shale beds from the uppermost Triassic ("Rhaetian") Calcare a Rhaetavicula in the Northern Apennines of Italy. The upper shale coincides with the abrupt termination of the distinctive, uppermost Triassic Rhaetavicula fauna and is overlain by the Hettangian (Lower Jurassic) Calcare Massiccio; no extinctions appear to be associated with the two lower layers, which occur 1.2 and 2.4 meters below the boundary shale. Approximately 5 to 10% of the quartz grains within these layers exhibit one or more sets of planar deformational features whose orientations cluster around the rational crystallographic planes (basal, omega, and pi) most commonly observed in shocked quartz. Textural and stratigraphic observations support an interpretation of at least three closely spaced impacts at the end of the Triassic.

TI THE SEPARATION BETWEEN GAS AND DUST FILAMENTS AT THE EDGE OF THE EXPANDING SHELL IN ERIDANUS

AB Adjacent filaments of ionized hydrogen, neutral hydrogen, and dust cross a 120 square degree region around l = 187-degrees, b = -50-degrees, at the boundary of a large expanding shell in Eridanus. The dust is visible on the IRAS Sky Flux Plates and looks like typical "interstellar cirrus." The morphology observed in H I emission is very similar, but with associated structures offset in position by amounts that vary across the region. The H I and IR filaments are approximately 1-degree wide and are offset by up to 0.8-degrees. All of the separation measurements have confidence levels of 95% or more. The H I and IR filaments are separated from parallel H-alpha filaments by 3-degrees-4-degrees. For the H I and IR emission in this region of the sky, a point-by-point comparison yields a very weak correlation between I(100) and N(HI); however, when I(100) at a dust feature is compared to N(H I) at the associated (offset) H I feature, a relationship close to that reported by other workers is revealed. Specifically, the nature of the separation between gas and dust is that the primary H I filament is deficient in dust by an order of magnitude, whereas the corresponding dust filament has sufficient gas to reproduce the dust/gas mass ratio approximately 1 x 10(-3) that is expected for cirrus. Observations of CO emission from this region show that the separation between the structures in the H I and IR emission is not due to a transition of the gas into molecular hydrogen at the location of the IR filaments. Indeed, the molecular hydrogen column density of these filaments is at least two orders of magnitude below what is typically seen in high-latitude molecular clouds. As the H I and dust in this region are associated with a large expanding shell (or superbubble), the action of shocks and radiation fields may be responsible for the separation of gas and dust. Such shells are believed to be common in the Galaxy, and therefore similar separations of gas and dust at other shell boundaries may be expected. Unless the gas and dust structures are resolved and lie in a favorable viewing geometry, the effect would tend to be hidden. Our results emphasize that it is not always evident, from observations with spatial resolutions coarser than a few arcminutes, how interstellar gas and dust are related.

ID wave-guides; linbo3; litao3; li1-xhxnbo3; crystals
AB The characteristics and properties of proton exchange and annealed proton exchange waveguides in lithium tantalate are investigated. Planar waveguides are first studied using secondary-ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) to obtain the hydrogen- and lithium-ion concentration profiles. From this data, accurate exchange and anneal diffusion coefficients are calculated. Optical propagation constants are also measured and used in conjunction with the SIMS results to calculate the change in the extraordinary refractive index at lambda = 0.6328 and 0.829 mum. Infrared-absorption measurements are also taken to monitor the exchange process. In addition, the surface damage due to proton exchange of the x facet of lithium tantalate is qualitatively investigated. Channel waveguides are also characterized. A parameter space study to determine the fabrication conditions necessary to achieve low-loss, single-mode waveguides at lambda = 0.829 mum is carried out. Mode near-field sizes and the fiber-to-output insertion losses are characterized as a function of anneal time. The polarization extinction ratio and optical damage threshold for typical waveguides are also measured.

AB We present the results of fitting a spherically symmetric circumstellar dust mo e to the peculiar source IRAS 09371 + 1212, a bipolar nebula with an extremely cool dust shell which exhibits clear evidence for large quantities of water ice. The entire spectrum in the wavelength range 2-100-mu-m can be well represented by a model employing grains with a silicate core and a water ice mantle. However, a small quantity of an additional grain species, such as graphite, is necessary to provide an extra source of opacity in the near-infrared. In particular, the 3.1-mu-m ice absorption feature and the two ice emission features at 44 and 62-mu-m can simultaneously be well fitted, showing that it is the same dust which gives rise to both features. It is found that a good fit can be obtained using crystalline ice particles, in agreement with the results of earlier simple models. Furthermore in view of the sharply peaked nature of the observed far-infrared energy distribution, radiative transfer effects cannot compensate for a substantially incorrect opacity law, such as that appropriate to amorphous water ice. Core region limb brightening is predicted at wavelengths where the shell is optically thin. A consequence of this is that the 3.1-mu-m ice absorption feature should be deepest at the inner boundary of the dust shell. Thus, the location of the inner boundary of the shell could be determined by obtaining spectra of the 3.1-mu-m feature at an angular resolution of better than 0.3 arcsec. The evolutionary status is discussed and the possibility that IRAS 09371 + 1212 may be a weak or naked T Tauri star rather than an evolved object, as is generally believed, is examined.

AB A method for deriving supernovae (SNs) luminosity functions is presented and it is used to derive the luminosity distribution of Type II SNs with "linear" light curves (SN II-L's).  The luminosity function (of the absolute B-magnitude at maximum) can be represented by a Gaussian centered on M(B) = -16.45 (for H0 = 75 km s-1 Mpc-1) with a 1-sigma dispersion of only +/- 0.3 mag and a few higher luminosity SNs.  The scatter about the mean is consistent with the uncertainties in the apparent B-magnitude at maximum and in the distances to the host galaxies.  This suggests that there is little or no intrinsic scatter in the absolute B-magnitude at maximum and therefore that the majority (90%) of SN II-L's are very good standard bombs.  There is a definite complete lack of low-luminosity SN II-L's.  This and the small scatter about the mean, implies that the reddening around SN II-L's cannot be large.  A weak correlation between absolute magnitude of the SNs and the inclination of the galaxy is consistent with a cosecant law such as could be used to describe extinction in the solar neighborhood.  The SN II-L's seem to be more strongly associated with giant H II regions than Type II SNs with a plateau (SN II-P's), and the majority of SN II-L's are probably massive stars.  It is suggested that mass loss in SN II-L's progenitors might lead to SN Ib's.  There are a few significantly higher luminosity SN II-L's, but after allowance for the volume selection effect, these are only 4%-8% of SN II-L's.

AB We have observed the far-ultraviolet spectrum (912-1860 angstrom) of the central portion of the Crab Nebula supernova remnant using the Hopkins Ultraviolet Telescope aboard the Astro-1 space shuttle mission in 1990 December. The synchrotron power-law continuum, greatly attenuated by interstellar absorption, can be seen extending down to approximately 1000 angstrom before being lost in the noise. The C IV lambda1549 emission line shows two resolved components representing the front and back sides of the shell expanding at roughly +/-1100 km s-1. This agrees well with the velocity distribution of optical [O III] emission at the same location in the Crab. The He II lambda1640 emission line, however, shows only a blueshifted component corresponding to the near side of the shell. These are the first observations to demonstrate that relative UV line intensity variations are present in the Crab Nebula. No other emission lines intrinsic to the Crab Nebula's filaments have been detected over the HUT wavelength range. We compare the HUT observation to optical emission-line imagery and to archival IUE observations. This comparison indicates that a distributed emission component, consisting of either a number of individually faint filaments or a diffuse component, produces the bulk of the emission seen by HUT. A grid of photoionization models for the Crab Nebula filaments is calculated to infer the range of ionization conditions and/or abundances that are needed to account for the observed UV line ratios and limits. Assuming that the diffuse redshifted and blueshifted emission seen with HUT arises in material of similar ionization parameter, the differing UV line ratios observed for these components probably indicates varying carbon and/or He abundances are present in the observed material.

AB We present near-infrared images and spectroscopy of the bipolar proto-planetary nebula AFGL 618. Emission from molecular hydrogen is detected in the 0.90-1.34-mu-m spectrum. From molecular hydrogen line ratios, we derive a visual extinction of A(V) = 3.4(-2.0)+4.0 mag to the H-2-emitting region. Models of collisionally excited and fluorescent H-2 emission are compared with the data: the near-infrared H-2 spectrum is dominated by emission from collisionally excited molecules at T(ex) almost-equal-to 2000 K, but a component of fluorescent emission is also present. The low level of fluorescent emission might indicate a clumpy structure, or one which partly shields the emitting region from the stellar continuum. We show that this type of near-infrared spectrum is an excellent tool for discriminating relatively low levels of fluorescent H-2 emission from a strong collisionally excited component. Images in the H- and K-bandpasses have been analyzed using models which assume single scattering of photons from the central object. The models indicate that the bipolar axis is inclined to the plane of the sky by i approximately 45-degrees-. An unresolved, compact source is seen in both images and is reproduced in the models. It is found that the emission in the H- and K-bands is consistent with single scattering of photons by dust with a distribution such that the dust density decreases with increasing stellar latitude and is nearly zero at the poles. A total visual attenuation at the stellar equator of A(V) approximately 87 mag is required to reproduce the images.

ID suspension-feeding community; soft substrata; evolutionary
AB The evolutionary and ecological recovery of benthic marine invertebrate faunas from the devastating Permian-Triassic mass extinction is poorly understood.  In particular, Paleozoic crinoids were decimated, creating an evolutionary bottleneck, so that Early Triassic (Scythian) and Anisian representatives of the genus Holocrinus may be considered the stem group for the monophyletic crinoid subclass Articulata, which includes all post-Paleozoic crinoids.  Crinoid ossicles in limestones of the Scythian (Spathian) Virgin Limestone Member (Moenkopi Formation) of southern Nevada and southwestern Utah, identified as Holocrinus?  smithi, represent the oldest known Holocrinus.  Limestone units of the Virgin were deposited in nearshore and inner shelf environments of an arid epeiric seaway.  Although these crinoids are generally completely disarticulated and occur commonly in storm-generated deposits, they are interpreted to have been deposited near their living sites in 'disturbed neighborhood' assemblages.  Counts of ossicles in bulk samples indicate a relatively low number of individuals, suggesting that populations of H.?  smithi occurred in scattered clumps or as isolated individuals, attached to hardgrounds or shell beds.  Bivalves are the most common associates, and are commonly more numerous than the estimated number of crinoid individuals, although bivalve species richness is never greater than three.  Virgin Limestone fossil assemblages probably represent the first redevelopment of relatively complex tiered epifaunal communities in the Mesozoic.

AB Using the results of CCD surface photometry for a sample of 284 spiral galaxies, we reinvestigate the problem of internal extinction.  Empirical formulae for the face-on correction of isophotal diameter, the I-band magnitude, and the V-I color are derived.  It is pointed out that the integrated absorption in a galaxy does not follow the extinction law that applies to individual stars in the galaxy, a simple fact which has been overlooked by many investigators.

AB We present UBV photometry of the stellar cluster associated with N59A, a dusty H II region in the LMC. N59A's main detected source of ionization is an 05 V (or possibly earlier type) star with a visual extinction of 1.2 mag. N59A also contains fifteen O-B3 stars that may contribute to the ionization; these stars are affected by greatly differing amounts of extinction. However, the observed stellar content of N59A cannot completely account for the ionization of the gas and the heating of the associated dust. Some early massive star(s) still probably lie undetected in the core of (or behind) the central absorbing cloud. In addition to this young population associated with the H II region, we detect an underlying older population of giant stars. We have also detected one Galactic star, and a few supergiant candidates. These results are discussed in terms of the initial mass function.

AB We have studied the IRAS colors of the ring nebula RCW 58 surrounding the Wolf-Rayet star HD 96548 (= WR 40; type WN 8) by analyzing the IRAS survey data with the Groningen Exportable High-Resolution Analysis system (GEISHA) and by using the Chopped Photometric Channel high-resolution imaging at 50-mu-m.  Additional JHKLM photometry of the exciting star of RCW 58, and also of HD 50896 (WR 6, type WN 5), exciting the bubble S308, and of HD 192163 (WR 136, type WN 6), exciting the bubble nebula NGC 6888, have been obtained. We have estimated the emission from dust in all three bubbles by subtracting the stellar contributions to the IRAS images and correcting the IRAS fluxes for atomic emissions.  Except for the 12-mu-m filter, the atomic contributions do not comprise the bulk of the observed fluxes.  As compared to the interstellar medium (ISM) and clouds, the dust emissions are very weak in 12-mu-m relative to 25-mu-m but have F(60)/(100) > 1, compared to less-than-or-equal-to 0.2 for the ISM, showing that the grains are heated by the enhanced radiation field in the vicinity of the central star. The dust emission is analyzed by means of several models.  For RCW 58, the diffuse dust model of Mathis, Rumpl, & Nordsieck, with optical constants as modified by Draine & Lee and grains in the size range 0.005-0.25-mu-m, produces fairly good agreement with the observations, except that the required radiation field is higher (almost-equal-to 100 eV cm-3) than one would expect from the mean distance of the bubble from the star (almost-equal-to 44 eV cm-3) with the stellar temperature we adopt.  It is possible to fit the spectrum with the expected radiation field if a combination of small grains (0.002-mu-m-0.008-mu-m) are in the inner part of the nebula and somewhat larger ones (0.005-mu-m-0.05-mu-m) farther out.  For S308 and NGC 6888, if there is enough radiation to produce the proper F(25)/F(60) from MRN grains the F(60)/F(100) flux ratio is too large.  However, small grains transiently heated by random absorptions of stellar photons produce too large a F(60)/F(100) ratio at the observed F(25)/F(60).  For these objects we find fits to both IRAS ratios by assuming that there are small grains transiently heated in the inner parts of the bubbles and standard interstellar grains in the outer portions.  The masses of material in the nebulae are consistent with most of the matter being stellar for RCW 58 and a substantial amount of material being contributed by the swept-up ISM for S308 and NGC 6888.  However, the masses are very sensitive to both the photometry and to the assumptions of the nature of the small grains near the star.  Quantitative estimates of the mass are only order of magnitude. Graphs are given which allow an easy estimation of the nebular mass for other situations for nebular excitation.  The principal parameter is the dilution factor of the stellar radiation.

TI THE IMPACT OF THE CRETACEOUS TERTIARY BOLIDE ON EVAPORITE TERRANE AND GENERATION OF MAJOR SULFURIC-ACID AEROSOL

AB Impact glasses from the K/T boundary in Haiti include high-Ca glasses with UP to 1 Wt.% SO3, formed by the fusion of anhydrite- or gypsum-rich evaporite sediments in the presence of high-silica melts, derived from melting of continental crust. Experimental studies have duplicated these two melts by fusion of gypsum and andesite, and suggest a formation temperature of 1300-degrees-C. Geochemical evidence from the glasses is consistent with their derivation from the 180 km diameter Chicxulub impact crater on the Yucatan peninsula (Mexico), situated in a thick late Cretaceous evaporite succession. This large-diameter crater is most likely the result of a cometary impact, on the basis of bolide scaling from the Ir anomaly in K/T boundary sediments. The sulfur degassing associated with formation of the high-Ca glass alone could have formed a 2 x 10(16) g H2SO4 stratospheric aerosol. However, the total sulfur degassing from the evaporite-rich sediments in the Chicxulub impact site may have led to formation of 3.8 x 10(18) to 1.3 x 10(19) g sulfate aerosol, and global atmospheric mass loading from the sulfate aerosol alone is estimated to beof the order of 1-2.6 g cm-2. Combined with the great optical depth estimates of Pollack et al. [1] and Covey et al. [2] resulting from an impact "dust" cloud, the sulfate aerosol may have contributed not only to a rapid decline in global surface temperatures to near-freezing in about one week, but also prolonged the cooling for several years because of the time-dependent conversion of SO2 to H2SO4 aerosol in the atmosphere. The contribution of sulfur to acid rain following the K/T boundary event may have equalled the proposed rainout of nitric acid.

AB Ecologists attempt to explain species diversity within Recent seabird communities in terms of Recent oceanographic and ecological phenomena. However, many of the principal oceanographic processes that are thought to structure Recent seabird systems are functions of geological processes operating at many temporal and spatial scales. For example, major oceanic currents, such as the North Pacific Gyre, are functions of the relative positions of continents and Antarctic glaciation, whereas regional air masses, submarine topography, and coastline shape affect local processes such as upwelling. I hypothesize that the long-term development of these abiotic processes has influenced the relative diversity and community composition of North Pacific seabirds. To explore this hypothesis, I divided the history of North Pacific seabirds into seven intervals of time. Using published descriptions, I summarized the tectonic and oceanographic events that occurred during each of these time intervals, and related changes in species diversity to changes in the physical environment. Over the past 95 years, at least 94 species of fossil seabirds have been described from marine deposits of the North Pacific. Most of these species are from Middle Miocene through Pliocene (16.0-1.6 Ma) sediments of southern California, although species from Eocene to Early Miocene (52.0-22.0 Ma) deposits are from Japan, British Columbia, Washington, and Oregon. During the history of the North Pacific seabirds, thee were many widespread (global) and local (California Current) oceanographic events, but the underlying physical processes that affected the diversity of seabirds throughout the North Pacific were tectonic changes that led to sequential stages of thermal isolation and refrigeration of Antarctica. Besides these broad-scale phenomena, the uplift of the Isthmus of Panama and the initiation and intensification of coastal upwelling in the California Current directly affected the diversity of seabirds in southern California. For the most part, Middle to Late Miocene and Pliocene seabird faunas from California resembled Recent communities, but with several exceptions: (1) the extreme diversity and abundance, but subsequent extinction of gannets (Morus) and flightless alcids (mancallids); (2) the comparatively low abundance and diversity of cormorants and shags (Phalacrocoracidae) until the Late Pliocene; and (3) the absence of marine Laridae until the Late Pliocene. By affecting both the physical and biological environments, geological factors such as Antarctic glaciation, eustatic changes in sea levels, and local tectonic activities influenced and will continue to influence the structure of seabird systems in the North Pacific.

AB A comprehensive study on the flammability, flame spread, and flame extinction behaviors of polymethylmethacrylate slabs and cylinders is presented. These behaviors have been quantified simultaneously for the first time in the Factory Mutual Research Corporation's 50 kW-Scale Flammability Apparatus. All experimental data show good agreement with the literature. A new technique has been developed to calculate pyrolysis height and flame spread rate from chemical and convective heat release rates. The calculated flame spread rate conveniently provides more information than obtained from the conventional methods. Flame spread behavior is found to be accelerating for upward spread and nonaccelerating for downward spread. Flame spread rate increases with increase in the oxygen mass fraction. Surface regression rates for upward and downward flame spread are negligible compared to the flame spread rates. Flame height is proportional to the pyrolysis height to the 2/3 power; ratio of flame height to pyrolysis height is proportional to the Froude number to the 2/3 power, and the flame height is proportional to the 2/3 power of the chemical heat release rate, in agreement with the literature. The study suggests that it is possible to use conventional flammability apparatus to simultaneously determine flame spread rate, heat release rate, and generation rates of material vapors and chemical compounds. It is our hope that this study will generate further research interest and standardized test apparatus and procedures will be developed.

AB Anionic isoperoxidases from cotton cotyledonary leaf tissue have been purified to electrophoretic homogeneity by chromatography on ion exchange, lectin affinity, and gel filtration matrices.  The enzyme was stable and active at a wide range of temperatures with optimal activity at 55-degrees-C.  Maximum activity was observed when the pH was adjusted from pH 5.5 to pH 7.5.  Electrophoresis on sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-polyacrylamide gels indicated a relative molecular mass of 56 000 Da when the sample was treated with a disulfide reducing agent and heated.  The electrophoretic mobility was altered when either the disulfide reducing agent or heat treatment was omitted.  Isoelectric focusing under native conditions resolved the activity into three isozymes with isoelectric points of 4.2, 4.4 and 4.6.  The K(m) of peroxidase for 4-aminoantipyrine and omicron-dianisidine was 350 and 36-mu-M, respectively.  Enzyme activity was inhibited by elevated concentrations of H2O2 and by disulfide reducing agents.  Known inhibitors of peroxidase activity such as potassium azide, sodium cyanide and sodium sulfite inhibited cotton anionic peroxidases.  The absorption spectrum showed maxima at 280 and 402 nm, indicating the presence of a heme group in the active enzyme.  The extinction coefficient at 402 nm was 1.12 x 10(5) mol-1 cm-1.

AB Stromgren and Hbeta photometry of 38 stars in the field of Ara OB1 is presented. The excesses, the absolute magnitudes and the temperatures of the stars have been obtained. The masses and the ages are also estimated, based on the models of Maeder & Meynet. Two different groups have been distinguished by their space locations at V0 - M(V) = 10.23 and 12.01 mag (assuming a normal extinction law). The more distant group is younger and more massive. The magnitude and the excess of the WR star MR62 point to its probable membership of this group. There are good reasons to suspect a value of the total-to-selective absorption ratio that is greater than the normal 3.2, which leads to a significant reduction of the true distance moduli.

TI MEASURING EVOLUTIONARY CONSTRAINTS - A MARKOV MODEL FOR PHYLOGENETIC TRANSITIONS AMONG SEED DISPERSAL SYNDROME
SO EVOLUTION

AB I introduce a Markov probabilistic model of transitions among discrete morphological states as a method for describing and testing nonrandom patterns of evolutionary change.  The Markov model assumes one-generational dependency, i.e., that the future direction of evolutionary change depends on the current morphology of a species, not on any history of changes.  This model is very flexible, allowing for any number of discrete states to describe morphology, yet permit rigorous testing of even complex evolutionary hypotheses.  I apply this model to changes in seed dispersal mechanisms within 571 genera of Neotropical plants, using cladistic methods to infer the ancestral and derived states within each genus.  I then test a series of progressively more complex hypotheses about the constraints that might shape the patterns of observed evolutionary transitions:  1) no transition constraints; 2) all dispersal mechanisms are equally labile evolutionarily; 3) the probability of particular evolutionary transition among dispersal mechanisms depends on the descendant state but on the ancestral state; 4) transition probabilities differ among pairs of dispersal mechanisms, but are reciprocal within such pairs.  More complex hypotheses matched the data significantly better than did simpler hypotheses.  However, only one of the hypotheses (reciprocal transitions) fit the observed data and then only for the most cautious interpretation of the frequencies of transitions within genera.  These results suggest that evolutionary transitions among major adaptive syndromes are indeed ordered, and the observed patterns of transitions suggest possible reasons for such macroevolutionary structure.

ID permian-triassic boundary; south-china
AB The Permo/Triassic mass extinction, the most extensive of all Phanerozoic extinctions [Erwin, 1990], has been correlated with both massive pyroclastic eruptions [Yang and Yin, 1987; Yin et al., 1989; Jinwen, 1989] and flood basalts [Rampino and Strothers, 1988]. More tentatively, the end-Cretaceous mass extinction has also been linked with massive volcanic events [Officer et al., 1987; Rampino and Strothers, 19881. However, the nature of the connection between volcanism and either mass extinction remains uncertain. Rather than study volcanic events at known extinction horizons, another approach is to identify extremely large (> 1000 km3) pyroclastic eruptions with well-constrained age determinations, and evaluate the fossil record for evidence of significant regional or global extinctions. We selected the largest, best constrained pyroclastic events known, (Toba Tuff, Huckleberry Ridge Tuff, Tuff of Blacktail and the Elkhorn Mountain volcanics); neither global marine diversity nor global or regional terrestrial vertebrate diversity exhibit any biological effect from these extremely massive pyroclastic eruptions. We conclude that massive pyroclastic eruptions are unlikely to have been an effective cause of mass extinctions. Mass extinction events involve a substantial loss of biologic diversity and may have substantial long-term evolutionary effects. Five major Phanerozoic events have been identified, and a number of smaller events may qualify as well [Sepkoski, 1990]. Loss of habitable area during marine regressions, extra-terrestrial impact, volcanic eruption, climatic change, marine anoxia, paleomagnetic reversal and salinity fluctuation are among the more prominent causes mooted to explain one or more of these events. Yet since many physical event may correlate with an individual mass extinction, it is frequently difficult to discriminate between various hypotheses proposed for a single mass extinction.

AB The local species richness of four different grassland fields fell an average of 37% during a 1988 drought that decreased above-ground living plant mass by an average of 47%. Despite the return to more normal plant mass and precipitation during the next two years, there was no significant recovery in species richness in the 46 permanent plots, suggesting that local species richness became recruitment limited. The drought led to the loss of annual species independent of their abundance. For perennial grasses, perennial forbs, legumes and woody species, the probability of a species being lost from a plot was significantly negatively correlated with its predrought abundance. These results demonstrate that environmentally extreme conditions can limit species richness by causing the local extinction of rare species. Because droughts of this intensity occur about every 50 years in the prairie, periodic drought may have limited prairie diversity. Moreover, if the accumulation of greenhouse gases leads to a more variable or extreme climate, it could cause increased rates of species extinctions.

TI MEASUREMENT OF THE FRACTAL DIMENSION OF SOOT USING UV LASER-RADIATION
SO LANGMUIR
LA English
DT Article
ID scattering; silica; flame; growth
AB Accurate values were determined for the fractal dimension of soot particulates formed in a small, over-ventilated C2H4/air diffusion flame. The experiment principally entailed measurement of the near forward to backward elastic scattering of UV laser light by the soot. Mass fractal dimensions were inferred from log-log plots of scattering versus the absolute value of the momentum transfer vector in the asymptotic, large scattering angle regime. The inferred dimensions were toward the low end of the reported range for soot. The scattering data were supplemented by measurements of optical extinction at the 266-nm laser wavelength, as well as extinction versus wavelength using a conventional lamp. The laser extinction data were used in evaluating particulate albedos, while the lamp data ruled out the possible interference of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon UV absorptions. The role of the primary monomer size in limiting the asymptotic range over which the fractal dimension may be determined is discussed.

AB Sensitive J, H and K imaging polarimetry of the low-mass young stellar object B5 IRSl reveals a very faint reflection nebula (mean K surface brightness congruent-to 7 muJy arcsec-2), composed of light scattered in a thin, limb-brightened dust shell associated with the blueshifted lobe of the weak molecular outflow from IRS1 itself. It appears that the flow is collimated on scales of approximately 20 arcsec by partial pressure confinement within the shell and that the shell density is maintained by residual lateral expansion of the flow. The polarization pattern close to the source suggests a disc around IRS1 and anomalous polarization patterns in the nebula are found to be qualitatively consistent with scattering from a population of grains deficient in sizes smaller than approximately 0.5 mum. As in other reflection nebulae, the surface brightness gradient in the scattered light is much shallower than theta-2. An explanation for this is sought by postulating gradients in extinction, scattering optical depth or grain albedo across the nebula. Forward-biased scattering alone can produce a shallow brightness distribution but, if isotropic scattering is assumed, an extinction gradient similar to that predicted for a collapsing protostellar core provides the best model of the current data. Multi-epoch photometry at J, H and K, compared with existing data, shows that the near-infrared luminosity of the source has declined significantly between 1983 and 1990 without significant change in colour. We suggest that this may indicate the growth of large grains (with colour-neutral extinction) in the disc around IRS1 and speculate that this process may lead to the formation of planetesimals.

AB The 3.3 mum emission band and the continuum at 3.2 mum have been mapped on a 9 x 4' area in the direction of the H II region-molecular cloud interface M 17 south-west, with a 30" beam. In addition, the 3.4 mum feature has been measured along a single east-west strip. The results show that the 3.3 mum emission band intensity traces a ridge between the H II region and the molecular cloud, whereas the 3.2 mum continuum is emitted in the H II region and shows a spatial distribution which is similar to the 10 mum continuum. Assuming that the 3.3 mum band is due to polycyclic aromatic molecules (PAHs), and taking into account the effect of dust extinction within the complex on the measured 3.3 mum intensity and on the ultraviolet content of the heating radiation field, we have estimated the abundance of the 3.3 mum emitter. The results show that the 3.3 mum emitting material is located in the direction of the molecular cloud and is practically absent from the H II region. Comparing our data with larger beam measurements, we show that except for the H II region, the fraction of the total infrared flux radiated in the 3.3 mum band is roughly constant throughout the complex and equal to 6 10(-4). Concerning the origin of the 10 mum continuum toward the H II region, we show that it can neither be explained by the heating of standard dust grains with Lyman alpha trapped photons, nor with dust cocoons around B stars. Instead, we use the dust model of Desert et al. (1990) which includes PAH and very small grains in addition to the classical dust grains, and we are able to fit the whole infrared available data from 2 mum to 100 mum, both for the H II region and for the molecular cloud. We assume that the emission arises respectively from the neutral clumps embedded in the ionized gas and the warm envelopes of the molecular clumps. We use a standard dust-to-gas mass ratio and only adjust the strength of the 3.3 mum band. The quasi-absence of 3.3 mum emission from the H II region and the strong near infrared emission from 2 to 20 mum, demonstrate the existence of very small particles, 3 to 12 angstrom, in this direction. Those may be fully de-hydrogenated PAHs or some other kind of particles resulting from the disruption of the bigger grains in the shocks associated to the star forming activity.

AB We measured with the IRAM 30 m telescope the continuum flux of the extremely luminous primeval galaxy IRAS 10214 + 4724 at a wavelength of 1.2 mm. This is the longest wavelength at which this galaxy's thermal continuum radiation has been detected; at z = 2.286, it corresponds to a rest wavelength of 370 mum. From the entire continuum spectrum we estimate a dust temperature of 80 K, and from the optically thin radiation at 370 mum (rest frame) we find a dust mass of 2.5 x 10(8) h-2 M.. For the H-2 mass of 1 x 10(11) h-2 M. implied by the CO line luminosity, this yields a ratio of the mass of gas (H-2 + He) to warm dust of 500, which is surprisingly normal for a galaxy at z = 2.3. It is the same value as observed in the central regions of nearby luminous galaxies that have solar metallicity. The ratio of observed CO and 370 mum (rest-frame) luminosities in 10214 + 4724, essentially the gas-to-dust mass ratio, is the same as in nearby galaxies. Hence, in this galaxy, most of the heavy elements have already been produced, at nearly present-day abundances.

AB Two experiments were conducted to estimate the retention of response-prevention effects using massed vs distributed treatments in a model of animal avoidance-learning.  In Exp. I, 120 rats were trained to avoid shock in a one-way platform avoidance apparatus.  Groups received response-prevention treatment or nontreatment in a 36-min. massed session or in several sessions distributed over a four-day period.  In Exp. II, 160 rats were given two trials of escape training in a one-way shuttle box.  Groups received response-prevention treatment or nontreatment in a 24-min. session of massed or distributed treatments delivered in one day.  Subjects in both studies were tested using a passive-avoidance paradigm immediately following treatment, 24 hours later, and 30 days later.  Analysis showed that response-prevention treatments were effective in reducing avoidance behavior and there were no significant differences in retention of avoidance associated with massed vs distributed response-prevention treatments.  Implications for animals and humans are discussed, and researchers are encouraged to change from a criterion training procedure to an escape procedure since the latter is a closer analogue to the human condition.

TI CHARACTERISTICS OF ANTARCTIC STRATOSPHERIC AEROSOLS DURING THE 1987 OZONE DEPLETION EPISODE BASED ON SAGE-II SATELLITE-OBSERVATIONS

AB The stratospheric aerosols play an important role in the formation of polar stratospheric clouds which are linked to Antarctic ozone depletion. The aerosol extinction profiles for higher latitudes have been monitored by the SAGE II (Stratospheric Aerosol and Gas Experiment II) satellite. In this study, features of Antarctic stratospheric aerosols during the ozone depletion episode of October 1987 are investigated based on the SAGE II data. The study focuses on (1) inferring the aerosol size spectrum using a modified randomized minimization search technique and (2) investigating the vertical, zonal, and columnar averages of aerosol properties such as extinction coefficient, optical depth, mean and effective radii, mass loading, total number concentration, and surface area concentration, together with the ozone concentration. The aerosol size distribution is found to be bimodal in several instances. An enhanced aerosol layer of relatively larger particles at altitudes between 21 and 23 km was found in Antarctic region. The effective radius can be fitted by Angstrom coefficient using either a linear or quadratic equation. On the average, in the region below 18 km, maximum values for the parameters of mass loading, total number, and surface area concentration were found to be located just above the region of the most severe ozone depletion. As to the columnar aerosol properties, bimodal feature in the size distribution is found during the days when the peak values of optical depth are greater than 10(-3). Relatively abundant population of smaller particles is associated with the region of severe ozone depletion. The distinct latitudinal gradients of these aerosol parameters suggest that the stratospheric aerosols are separated into two regimes near 62-degrees-S-63-degrees-S, probably as a result of the dynamics introduced by polar vortex. Smaller and larger particles dominate at higher and lower latitudes, respectively. The standard deviation for both mean and effective radii are about 20-25% of the mean values. The fluctuation of the mass loading is about 50% from the mean and about 90% for the total number. The mean optical depth in 15-30 km layer is of the order of 10(-3). The average columnar ozone amount is about 95 DU (Dobson unit) with the amplification of about 48 DU. It is pointed out that the reported features of the stratospheric aerosols in the Antarctic region are useful in providing insights into the mechanisms for ozone depletion.

AB Using data obtained with the IRAS and groundbased telescopes, the spectral energy distribution of the pre-main sequence stars HD 176386, TY CrA, R CrA and T CrA were constructed and analysed. For all stars two possible models, one based on a normal extinction law and another one with an extinction law characterized by R > 3.1 are considered. Only the latter model turns out to be acceptable. HD 176386 and TY CrA have excess radiation in the far infrared only. This excess is caused by rather cool dust (T approximately 95 K) located at quite a distance from the central star (up to about 1000 AU). The stars R CrA and T CrA not only have excess radiation in the far-IR but in the near-IR as well. This near-IR excess is caused by a dust shell located close to the star (within 2 AU) with an average temperature of 1310 K (R CrA) and 1370 K (T CrA). Analysis of the properties of these hot dust shells, based on a spherical symmetric model, indicate large particles of iron and/or graphite to be the most likely constituents. HD 176386 is constant in brightness, whereas TY - CrA shows only minor (< 0.m15) fluctuations. R and T CrA are both variable stars (maximum DELTA-V = 4.m4 and 2.m6, respectively). We believe that this difference is due to the presence or absence of dust close to the central star. In the HR diagram all four stars are located in the region where intermediate mass pre-main sequence stars are theoretically predicted to be found (Palla & Stahler 1990). With Iben (1965) it is seen that the variable stars R CrA and T CrA are relatively younger compared to the not or hardly variable stars HD 176386 and TY CrA. Therefore, we believe the presence of hot dust relatively close to these stars to represent a (very) young stage of pre-stellar evolution. HD 176386 and TY CrA are probably in a more evolved stage of evolution, one in which this dust has already been cleared away.

AB We present maps of the CO J = 3 --> 2 and (CO)-C-13 J = 2 --> 1 molecular line and mid- to far-infrared continuum emission of the interface between the Cepheus B molecular cloud and the S155 HII region. Far-infrared dust colour temperature and optical depth maps show the molecular cloud to be externally heated and that the edge of the cloud is compressed by the expansion of S155. The data are compared with current models, and various dust grain parameters are derived. A hotspot is observed in the CO J = 3 --> 2 emission line, at a position coincident with the radio continuum and infrared emission peaks. The infrared, radio continuum and molecular line emission from the hotspot are all consistent with it being a compact HII region, ionized by an embedded B1-B0.5 star. The position of the compact HII region, adjacent to the northwestern edge of Cep B, suggests it is the product of a phase of sequential OB star formation, which has already been responsible for the youngest subgroup of the Cepheus OB3 association. The mass of the cloud is estimated to be approximately 100-200M..

AB Planktonic foraminifera have radiated three times since the mid-Cretaceous and independently evolved similar morphological groups and patterns of species longevity in each diversification. All morphological groups include substantial numbers of short-ranging species, but only some groups include large numbers of long-ranging taxa. The long ranges of these 'extinction-resistant' taxa are unlikely to be due to systematic differences in geographic range, body size, or taxonomic practice. Instead, life history traits such as trophic ecology and factors influencing population structure are closely correlated with species longevity during each of the radiations. Generation time and reproductive output are correlated with longevity in living species but the significance of these factors for extinct taxa is unknown. Other variables such as depth distribution are inversely correlated with longevity in Neogene and Cretaceous biotas, but not in Paleogene foraminifera. Perhaps the ability to use a wide variety of food types and maintenance of large populations contribute to extinction resistance. It is possible that these traits are correlated with life in geologically persistent watermasses. Indeed, long-ranging species are concentrated in geologically old, stable environments in the oligotrophic gyres and waters below the thermocline. In contrast, species that live in ephemeral boundary layers are frequently short-ranging. It may be the stability and trophic conditions in water-masses have been the ultimate arbitrators of species longevity.

TI CALCAREOUS NANNOFOSSIL AND DINOFLAGELLATE STRATIGRAPHY ACROSS THE CRETACEOUS TERTIARY BOUNDARY AT HOR HAHAR, ISRAEL
SO MARINE MICROPALEONTOLOGY

AB In Israel, the Cretaceous/Tertiary (K/T) boundary at Hor Hahar occurs within the interval from the top of the Ghareb Formation (Maastrichtian) to just below the horizon of dark marl and clay within the overlying Taqiye Formation (Paleocene). The studied interval contains all the calcareous nannofossil zones: Micula prinsii (latest Maastrichtian), Markalius inversus - NP1 (earliest Paleocene), and Cruciplacolithus tenuis - NP2 (Early Paleocene). They correlate in sequence with the Abathomphalus mayaroensis, P0 P1a, P1b, and P1c planktic foraminiferal zones. The palynological assemblages consist mainly of dinocysts with only few pollen grains and spores. These assemblages are used to interpret five stratigraphic phases of environmental change across the K/T boundary in the Hor Hahar section. In the latest Maastrichtian, there is an overwhelming dominance of the nannofossil Micula decussata, which probably reflects environmental stress preceding the terminal Cretaceous mass extinction. A nearshore marine environment at the boundary is suggested by the increase in number of specimens of the dinocyst Cyclonephelium, and by the predominance of terrigenous organic matter sediment. There followed two episodes of transgression and regression. The calcareous cystproducing dinoflagellate Thoracosphaera (Futterer, 1976) becomes dominant in two episodes at the boundary and approximately one meter above it. It alternates in abundance with the organic-walled dinoflagellates, which suggests that different environmental parameters were operating for each group. Maastrichtian dinocysts decline in abundance toward the K/T boundary. They reach greatest abundance and species diversity at the same strata where foraminiferids recover after their mass extinction at the boundary. Calcareous nannofossils recover only later in the early Paleocene. Changes in delta-C-13 and total organic carbon, as as well as dinocyst and nannofossil composition indicate an episode of strong ecological stress about one meter above the boundary.

TI ROLE OF TEMPERATURE AND NUTRIENTS IN EXTINCTION OF TURRITELLINE GASTROPODS - CENOZOIC OF THE NORTHWESTERN ATLANTIC AND NORTHEASTERN PACIFIC

AB Turritelline gastropods (Mesogastropoda, Turritellidae) are common to abundant components in many fossil (Cretaceous, Cenozoic) and Recent marine benthic communities, but the environmental factors affecting their evolution and extinction are poorly understood. This is in large part because today they occur most abundantly in cooler waters associated with upwelling or other high-nutrient conditions, but thermal tolerances and preferences are unclear for extinct turritelline species. Turritellines were diverse and abundant throughout the New World for much of the Cenozoic. Beginning in the early Neogene, through both extinction and range contraction, however, they started to disappear from higher latitudes on both Atlantic and Pacific coasts of North and Central America. The highest rate of extinction took place in the western Atlantic in the Plio-Pleistocene, when almost all turritelline species in this area became extinct. Preliminary comparison of the available stratigraphic record suggests that this paleobiogeographic pattern is not an artefact of the record. This biogeographic shift coincides with a postulated regional mass extinction among all marine mollusks in the western Atlantic at around the same time. Causes for turritelline extinction, however, appear to be more complex than the decline in temperature that is cited most often as the probable cause of the western Atlantic molluskan extinction event. Neogene turritellines in the western Atlantic appear to have been adversely affected by collapse and/or major reorganization of oceanic productivity associated with the formation of the Isthmus of Panama. Nutrients thus may have been more important than temperature change in controlling extinction probability in this group.

TI GLOBAL CHANGE IN EARTH HISTORY - A PERSONAL POINT-OF-VIEW
SO TERRA NOVA
LA English
DT Article
AB The global changes of the past took place during the progress of geological cycles and marked a drastic passage from an ancient Pangaean regime of continental emergence to a new Tethyan regime of submergence. They occurred with a certain violence and rapidity, and represented critical phases in the destabilization and subsequent reorganization of the geosphere and biosphere. This process resulted in the destruction of certain assemblages (e.g. biotic mass extinctions) and the rise of new ones (e.g. the emergence of new taxa). These major phases of evolution and growth were probably connected to the upwelling of hot mantle material from great depths and a subsequent process of lateral spreading and outward migration of the mantle melt. The ensuing marked increase in mantle activity, degassing and explosive volcanicity produced catastrophic environmental perturbations with turning points in tectonics, global climate, sea level, ocean and atmospheric chemistry, palaeocirculation and palaeogeography.

TI DINOFLAGELLATE AND CALCAREOUS NANNOFOSSIL RESPONSE TO SEA-LEVEL CHANGE IN CRETACEOUS-TERTIARY BOUNDARY SECTIONS
SO GEOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
ID alabama; braggs
AB Stratigraphic sections in south-central Alabama were studied to test palynological evidence of sea-level change across the Cretaceous-Tertiary boundary. New evidence from both calcareous nannofossils and dinoflagellate cysts places the regional disconformity in Alabama (Type 1 sequence boundary) virtually at the K-T boundary. This suggests that sea-level fall may have contributed to the mass-extinction event. Dinoflagellate diversity varies between systems tract components of coastal onlap. This parameter is useful for interpreting sea-level change in this part of the section, because dinoflagellates did not participate in the mass extinction. The iridium spikes in the roadcut near Braggs are of earliest Danian age and correlate in relative magnitude with the lower values reported from directly above the K-T boundary in the Gubbio stratotype section. Iridium was concentrated in marine flooding surfaces in episodes of higher productivity of algal organic matter at the time when the iridium-enriched ocean encroached on the shelf during the first Cenozoic episode of sea-level rise.

DT Article
AB Aircraft-based measurements of optical extinction, optical scattering, and particle mass concentrations were obtained in the smoke from the Kuwait oil fires during May and June 1991. These measurements were used to derive optical absorption, single-scattering albedo (omega), specific absorption and the amount of soot in the smoke. Measurements were made in smoke from individual oil wells, pool fires and in composite smoke plumes. The value of omega for smoke from the individual fires was either 0.35-0.4 (for the black smoke) or 0.85-0.95 (for the white smoke). For the aged composite plume from all of the fires, omega ranged from 0.52 to 0.6. The specific absorption of the composite smoke varied from about 2 m2 g-1 near the fires to about 1.5 m2 g-1 well downwind.

AB An unbiased survey of a flux limited sample of cool IRAS sources towards the Giant Molecular Clouds (GMCs) in the constellation of Vela has revealed the majority of the objects also in the near infrared. The search area is as extended as 250 square degrees and contains 55 very red IRAS-bright point sources. Among these, almost half qualified as bona fide Lada & Wilking Class I sources being associated with the Vela Molecular Ridge (VMR) in the third galactic quadrant. We have obtained, as well as re-examined various existing, distance determinations towards these dark clouds and find that major parts of the VMR are relatively closeby (700 +/- 200 pc). From the derived bolometric luminosities of the Class I sources we can conclude that no 0 stars are presently being formed in these clouds. The median luminosity of the brightest among the Class I sources in the nearby VMR ig slightly less than 600 L., which corresponds to theoretical model luminosities of prestellar objects of intermediate mass (approximately 5M.). The volume density of these objects is N(M greater than or similar to M.) = 5 10(4) kpc-3, which is very much smaller than that found for the L 1641 cloud in Orion, and indicative of a relatively low star formation efficiency at present. The number of Class I objects in the VMR evolving towards B type main sequence stars appears consistent with the overall steady state formation of such stars in the solar neighbourhood. From an independent estimate of the formation time scale it is suggested that the theory of stellar formation, originally developed for stars of lower mass, is applicable also to intermediate mass stars. We propose that the GMCs in Vela, being stretched out along the galactic plane, provide a close-up view of typical, initially relatively quiescent, galactic star formation.

DT Article; Proceedings Paper
AB This paper presents data on the scattering behaviour of base-catalyzed silica aerogels at a wavelength of 633 nm. Scattering from the bulk, which is nearly isotropic, and scattering from the surface, which is strongly forward peaked, were detected. The former can be influenced by changing the processing pH value and the density, but the latter has not been controllable in a systematic way. The mass specific extinction for aerogels as a function of density, thickness and wavelength was measured, using a double beam spectrometer.

AB We have monitored over an interval of 1 month the linear polarization in visible light of three single Wolf-Rayet stars, WR 14 (WC6), WR 25 (WN7), and WR 69 (WC9).  As for other early-type WC stars, WR 14 is not significantly variable (at the sigma approximately 0.03% level) during this set of observations; however, its mean polarization level is significantly different from its value in 1987.  The two other stars do vary (sigma approximately 0.06%) as expected for late-type W-R stars of either sequence.  The high value of P(max)/E(B-V) greater-than-or-equal-to 11 for WR 25 suggests an extremely high efficiency of grain alignment in the line of sight to the star.  The wavelength dependency of the polarization angle, as well as long-term variability in the U band, suggest some intrinsic polarization component as well for this star.

AB We have acquired comprehensive spectroscopic data on the luminous blue variable eta-Car and its associated Homunculus Nebula. Spectral maps of eta-Car and the Homunculus were obtained at resolutions from 3 angstrom to 0.7 angstrom, and at a spatial resolution of about 1". These data strongly constrain models of the system. In this paper we give a first analysis based on a subset of the data. The Homunculus spectrum arises from a combination of low-excitation intrinsic emission and from scattering of radiation originating in the central region. The scattered component shows P Cygni emission on H I, He I, Fe II and the Na D lines, demonstrating that the central object is related to the P Cygni type stars. From the absence of He II lambda-4686, we infer that the effective temperature of the central star is < 30000K. The presence of both intrinsic and dust scattered emission allows us to use the observed velocity structure to rule out previous interpretations of the Homunculus as an ongoing bipolar flow whose axis is close to the plane of the sky. Instead we infer that the south-east lobe is an incomplete, hollow shell, expanding towards us at near constant velocity. Profiles in the north west are more complex, with two or more components on most emission lines. The flow pattern is difficult to interpret. In the outer regions of the north-west lobe we are probably seeing a shell of material similar to that in the south-east, but expanding away from us. Closer to the central source blue-shifted intrinsic emission is also seen. Significant profile variations are found to occur in the central 3.6" x 3.6". The variations provide tantalizing evidence that at a scale of 1" we are beginning to resolve the [Fe II] formation region, or perhaps some inner dust structure. While the Homunculus is primarily a reflection nebula, its spectrum does not match that of the central region. The equivalent width (EW) of H I and He I is typically 30% smaller, while the EW of [Fe II] lines is at least a factor of 5 smaller than in the core. We interpret these differences to imply that we view the central source through a dust condensation. The dust strongly attenuates the central source but not the [Fe II] emission which arises coincident with, or outside, the dust region. The dust is not spherically distributed, so the Homunculus scatters radiation that has suffered relatively little attenuation.

AB Knowledge of the morphology and dynamics of particulates in combustion systems is important because of its implications in critical research and practical areas as: (a) studies of the anisotropic characteristics of particulates in reacting systems, (b) particle growth and oxidation studies in flame systems, (c) production and control of ceramic aerosols with specific sizes and shapes, (d) studies of the agglomeration mechanisms and in situ determination of the characteristic fractal dimensions in fractal systems (e) mixing rates in multiphase systems and prediction of radiative transport from such systems, and (f) fine particle control in the electrons industry. The in situ light scattering and extinction techniques in the context of particulate sizing and morphology determination are reviewed and compared. The classical light scattering, extinction and scattering intensity ratios techniques may yield accurate particle size when the refractive indices of the particles are accurately known. However, the inferred particle size from the measured scattering and extinctions ratios may change by 75% or more when the real part of the refractive index varies in the range 1.3-2.0. On the other hand, the inferred total particle mass may change by a factor of two or more for the same range of values of the real part of the refractive index. Furthermore, the scattering intensity ratios that have been used for size measurements vary by 30% or more for particle diameters larger than 0.15-mu-m and the changes in the real part of the index by 15% or higher. The applications of the single particle light scattering theory to the characterization of agglomerates that consists of Rayleigh size units are reviewed and the limitations are discussed. Since apart from the classical scattering and extinction techniques the dynamics isotropic light scattering has been used for sizing of spherical particles based on their translational diffusion in flame systems, its advantages and limitations are also presented. Furthermore, it should be noted that most particulates in reacting systems depart from sphericity because of coagulation and/or surface growth and become optically anisotropic. Since in such cases the depolarized light scattering is suitable for particle shape characterization, comparisons are made between the gaseous molecular anisotropic scattering and the scattering corresponding to the anisotropic particulates. The suitability of the technique for particle morphology characterization in flames is assessed. In addition, the new approach of characterizing flame particulates using fractal analysis is summarized and its limitations are discussed.

AB 76 apparently faint galaxies in the galactic plane in Puppis (1 almost-equal-to 245-degrees, Absolute value of b < +/- 8-degrees) were observed with the 100 m radio telescope in Effelsberg. The detection rate is quite high (38 certain, 1 confused and 4 possible detections). It depends neither on galactic latitude nor on magnitude, underscoring the fact that H I-line measurements are indeed a powerful method of obtaining redshifts for highly obscured spiral galaxies. Rough corrections of the magnitudes for extinction show that most of the galaxies are actually quite bright ([m(B)0] less-than-or-equal-to 14.5m). The majority of the galaxies were detected at fairly low velocities (v0 < 3000 km s-1. These are concentrated in four groups. The most massive one (at v0 almost-equal-to 1450 km s-1) turns out to form part of a wall that crosses the galactic plane vertically. These newly disclosed nearby groups and filaments might contribute to the peculiar motion of the Local Group. A more distant filament at v0 almost-equal-to 5000 km s-1 is indicated in the distribution as well and seems connected to outlying extragalactic large-scale structures. The global properties of the observed galaxies such as total mass, H I-mass and M(H I)/L(B) are normal in every respect and reflect the properties of a typical nearby sample of galaxies. The infrared properties of the 34 galaxies listed in the IRAS PSC such as the f100/f60 color temperature and the ratio of the blue to infrared flux are found to be representative of an optically selected galaxy sample [[log(f100/f60)] = 0.53, [log (L(FIR)/L(B)0)]= -0.34], and the infrared luminosity L(FIR) to correlate with the H I-mass.

ID photometry
AB This paper reports UBVRI photoelectric photometry of stars lying in the field of the open cluster NGC 6193. These data were added to previous spectroscopic results from other authors. The attention is focused onto earlier analysis, which had suggested that in this region both, the E(U-B)/E(B-V) excess relation and the extinction law are not standard. But, the new data support that both, E(U-B)/E(B-V) and the extinction law have values which may be assumed to be the standard ones. It was found that the near infrared anomalies are related in some cases to binary stars. Single stars also showing near infrared excess could be explained in terms of circumstellar shell hypothesis. A similar feature is found among stars in the open cluster Tr 16. The cluster age is not greater than 3.1 x 10(6) yr from isochrones computed for models with mass loss and overshooting. The distance obtained is 1410 pc.

AB Faunas of disarticulated ossicles, particularly columnals, are a potentially important source of data for helping to elucidate the patterns of evolution and extinction shown by pelmatozoans in the late Ordovician. The columnal fauna of the Hirnantian High Mains Formation, Craighead Inlier, Strathclyde, includes the following morphotaxa: Cyclocyclicus (col.) foraminosus sp. nov.; Cyclocyclicus (col.) periogmos sp. nov.; Hypsinomocrinus (col.) lewisi gen. et sp. nov.; Tetragonotetragonalis (col.) girvanensis sp. nov.; and Pentagonopentagonalis (col.) sp. This is the first Hirnantian columnal fauna to be described from the North American province; it is distinctly different from Hirnantian columnal biota described from Wales and Kazakhstan.

AB Stacking reactions of the bridge-deprotonated Cp*Co(2,3-Et2C2B3H3-5-X)- complexes (la-1f; X = Cl, Br, CH3, C(O)CH3, CH2C=CCH3, H; Cp* = eta5-C5Me5) with cobalt(II) and nickel(II) halides in THF gave, respectively, diamagnetic [Cp*CoIII(Et2C2B3H2X)]2NiIV (2a-2e) and paramagnetic [Cp*CoIII(Et2C2B3H2X)]2CoIV (3a-3f) tetradecker sandwich complexes. A similar reaction of the B(5)-chloro reagent la using RuCl2 gave the diamagnetic trichloro complex(Cp*CO)2(2,3-Et2C2B3H2-5-Cl)(2,3-Et2C2B3H-4,5[5,61-Cl2)Ru(4). In all cases except the Co-Co-Co compound 3f (X = H), the products were isolated as dark crystalline solids via chromatography on silica; 3f decomposes on silica and was isolated via fractional crystallization from a cold solution. All of the tetradeckers are air-stable in the solid state and in solution except 3f, which is stable only as a solid. Characterization of these compounds was based on H-1, B-11, and C-13 NMR (for diamagnetic species), UV-visible, and mass spectra, supported by X-ray crystallographic data on the Co-Ni-Co and Co-Co-Co dichloro compounds (2a and 3a), the Co-Ni-Co diacetyl complex (2d), and the Co-Ru-Co sandwich 4. The structurally characterized compounds are tetradecker sandwiches, slightly bent in the middle (8-15-degrees) but exhibiting no significant ring slippage relative to the coordinated metal atoms. The carborane rings in these sandwiches are mutually rotated by 27-89-degrees. The electronic spectra exhibit intense absorption bands between 350 and 440 nm with extinction coefficients between 28 000 and 43 000 M-1 cm 1. The molecular geometries and spectroscopic properties of the tetradeckers can be qualitatively correlated with published molecular orbital calculations on the ideal CP4Co3+ tetradecker system. The formation and stabilization of the tetradecker complexes is favored by precursor complexes (e.g., la-1f) having relatively electron-withdrawing X substituents, as measured by the shift to low field of the H-1 NMR B-H-B signal.

AB A sample of 15 000 faint spiral galaxies is used for the statistical determination of internal absorption by investigating the projected surface brightness. Analyses with different disc models yield small absorption values. For a more realistic three-component model, however, a central face-on optical depth of tau-0 = 7 is obtained, which is in agreement with suggestions that spiral galaxies are not optically thin.

TI GOAL AVERSIVENESS AFTER ESCAPE TRAINING WITH SHORT AND LONG INTERTRIAL INTERVALS
SO BULLETIN OF THE PSYCHONOMIC SOCIETY
LA English
DT Article
ID shocked extinction trials; self-punitive behavior; acquisition trials; percentage
AB Different intertrial intervals (ITIs) may influence the aversiveness of the goal area in aversive training with one-way procedures.  That possibility was explored.  Albino rats were given 20 shock-escape runway trials with short or long ITIs followed by 5 extinction test trials with goal-box measures for latency to eat,  climb out, and move onto a wood floor.  Different measures produced different outcomes.  "Time to eat" did not differentiate groups.  Massed-trials animals were quicker to "move over" initially but slowed down over trials.  Spaced and massed procedures did not produce initial differences on "climb out," but spaced-trials animals speeded up over trials and massed-trials animals slowed down.  Results suggested that differences in ITIs did not generate major differences in levels of aversion in the "safe" area.  ITI effects on performance may be due to differential effects on the conditioning process.

TI LINEAR-POLARIZATION OF STARS IN 7 METAL-POOR GLOBULAR-CLUSTERS
SO ASTRONOMICAL JOURNAL
LA English
DT Article
ID near-infrared photometry; omega-centauri; giant branch; interstellar polarization; chemical inhomogeneity; wavelength dependence; main-sequence; bright stars; dust; m22
AB We present polarization measurements of more than 250 stars, most of them red giants, in the fields of seven metal-poor globular clusters.  We find strong spatial variations of the polarization in the fields of NGC 4372, NGC 4833, M4, and NGC 6266, and we conclude that differential reddening is important in these clusters.  Mild extinction variations are found across omega Cen and M22, while the interstellar medium toward NGC 6397 appears fairly uniform.  After taking the foreground polarization component into account, we find no evidence for significant intrinsic polarization in any of the stars observed.  We argue that an extreme Population II environment is very deficient in dust.  We discuss this result in terms of different mechanisms for mass loss proposed for Population II red giants.

AB The migratory and reproductive behaviour of Bufo calamita was studied at four neighbouring breeding sites in the northern Rhineland, Germany, from 1986 to 1991. Radio telemetry and marking systems based on toe-clipping and on microchips were used to follow the tracks of toads and for individual recognition. Emphasis lay on estimates of (1) the exchange of reproductive individuals between neighbouring sites, and (2) the reproductive success at each site. Allozyme electrophoresis served to assess the genetic diversity of local populations. More than 90% of all reproductive males showed a lifelong fidelity to the site of first breeding, whereas females did not prefer certain breeding sites. Due to the female-biased exchange of individuals among neighbouring sites the genetic distance between local populations was generally low but increased with geographical distance. This pattern of spatial relations is consistent with the structure of a metapopulation. Moreover, up to three mass immigrations of males per breeding period, replacing previously reproductive individuals, suggested the existence of temporal populations successively reproducing at the same locality. Genetic distances were considerably greater between temporal populations than between local ones, indicating partial reproductive isolation. In fact, an exchange of reproductive individuals between the temporal populations at each site was not detected, but gene flow due to the recruitment of first-breeders originating from offspring other than their own seems probable. Thus, natterjack metapopulations consist of interacting local and temporal populations. The reproductive success differed considerably among the four sites and also between the temporal populations. Three out of four local populations had low reproductive success as well as the latest temporal population. The persistence of these populations depended entirely on the recruitment of juveniles from the only self-sustaining local population. This "rescue-effect" impeded local extinction. The discussion focuses on the modifications required to fit the classical metapopulation concept to the empirical findings and their consequences for the dynamics of amphibian metapopulations.

AB Evolutionary calculations of high-metallicity horizontal-branch stars show that for the relevant masses and helium abundances, post-HB evolution in the HR diagram does not proceed toward and along the AGB, but rather toward a "slow blue phase" in the vicinity of the helium-burning main sequence, following the extinction of the hydrogen shell energy source. For solar and twice solar metallicity, the blue phase begins during the helium shell-burning phase (in agreement with the work of Brocato and Castellani & Tornambe); for 3 times solar metallicity, it begins earlier, during the helium core-burning phase. This behavior differs from what takes place at lower metallicities. The implications for high-metallicity old stellar populations in the Galactic bulge and for the integrated colors of elliptical galaxies are discussed.

AB Abundances of carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen in 22 regions of the Orion Nebula are derived using diagnostic emission lines measured from IUE and ground-based spectrophotometry and imagery. In order to minimize geometrical complications, the regions chosen lie in the relatively smooth area of the nebula west of the Trapezium and extend outward to about 5'. For 20 of the regions, both C III] lambda-1909 and C n] lambda-2326 were measured from the IUE spectra, and combined with optical line strengths of [O II], [O III], [N II], H-beta, and Ha to study spatial variations in the ionic and total elemental concentrations of C, N, and O. A detailed analysis of UV-optical extinction, temperature gradients, and density gradients using new and previously reported observations is given. Empirical CNO abundances are derived for each position using both on-the-spot values for T(e) (from [O III] and EN II]) and N(e) (from [S II]), as well as global mean values for the nebula. For both situations of T(e)-N(e) gradients and an isothermal nebula we find no evidence of the existence of radial gradients in C, N, or O westward from the Trapezium (within +/- 0.2 dex rms). However, the mean concentrations of C, N, and O relative to H found using directly observed temperatures are much lower than solar; in terms of 12 + log (X/H) we derived (C, N, O) = (7.94, 7.50, 8.45). Rather than conclude that the Orion Nebula is depleted in CNO compared to the Sun, we propose the existence of significant temperature fluctuations in the nebula. For such, the auroral transitions of the [O III] and [N II] multiplets are enhanced by a hotter medium (possibly wind-driven or shock-ionized) compared to the mass-loaded and denser regions which emit the bulk of the nebular transitions. We show that an assumed rms temperature fluctuation of 0.055 gives abundances of (C, N, 0) = (8.78, 7.73, 8.90), where the oxygen is solar and, within our error bars, the carbon is near solar. Additional support for Orion having near-solar abundances comes from the results of a grid of constant-density nebular models based on a single ionizing source with T(eff) = 37,500 K (similar to theta-1 Ori C). We find that the " mean " UV-optical spectrum of a " core " region approximately 1' W of the Trapezium can be readily matched with a model of solar O, N, Ne, and S with enhanced C and Ar. The lower temperatures found in such a model are consistent with a rms temperature fluctuation of 0.055. We compare our simple model results with more sophisticated "blister" and "dust" models of M42 published recently and discuss some of the implications that the complications of Orion have with regard to the greater problem of abundance determinations in Galactic and extragalactic H II regions.

AB The phenomena of the induction and entrainment of adjunctive behaviours was investigated in eight people with severe or profound mental retardation who exhibited stereotypic behaviours. The occurrence of collateral behaviours was investigated under extinction and massed reinforcer baselines and a variety of periodic or intermittent schedules of reinforcement for the performance of a simple experimental task Seven of the eight subjects demonstrated evidence of schedule-induced stereotypic behaviour in the experimental conditions; five of the eight subjects also showed evidence of the entrainment of these behaviours within the first third of the interreinforcement interval The results are discussed in relation to the analysis and intervention of problem behaviours in people with severe or profound mental retardation.

AB Studies of the climate and atmosphere of Mars are limited at present by a lack of meteorological data having systematic global coverage with good horizontal and vertical resolution. The Mars Observer spacecraft in a low, nearly circular, polar orbit will provide an excellent platform for acquiring the data needed to advance significantly our understanding of the Martian atmosphere and its remarkable variability. The Mars Observer pressure modulator infrared radiometer (PMIRR) is a nine-channel limb and nadir scanning atmospheric sounder which will observe the atmosphere of Mars globally from 0 to 80 km for a full Martian year. PMIRR employs narrow-band radiometric channels and two pressure modulation cells to measure atmospheric and surface emission in the thermal infrared: a visible channel (0.39-4.7 mum) is used to measure solar radiation reflected from the atmosphere and surface. Vertical profiles of atmospheric temperature, the infrared extinction of dust suspended in the atmosphere, atmospheric water vapor, and condensate hazes will be retrieved from infrared measurements having a vertical resolution of 5 km, which is half an atmospheric scale height. PMIRR infrared and visible measurements will be combined to determine the radiative balance of the polar regions, where a sizeable fraction of the global atmospheric mass annually condenses onto and sublimes from the surface. Derived meteorological fields, including diabatic heating and cooling and the vertical variation of horizontal winds, will be computed from the globally mapped fields retrieved from PMIRR data. Analyses of these observed and derived fields will address many key questions regarding the atmosphere and climate of Mars.

AB The clouds associated with the Herbig Ae/Be stars LKH-alpha-198, HD 200775 and RR Tau are examined in order to study the effects of the young stars on the surrounding gas and dust. Mapping of the J = 2 --> 1 and J = 1 --> 0 transitions of CO and (CO)-C-13 towards these clouds and IRAS maps at 12, 25, 60 and 100-mu-m are presented. The (CO)-C-12 and (CO)-C-13 emission towards the reflection nebulosity associated with HD 200775, NGC 7023, is very weak. There is no (CO)-C-12 and (CO)-C-13 emission towards VDB1, the reflection nebulosity located to the southwest of LKH-alpha 198. Sharp borders are found between the bulk of the molecular clouds and the reflection nebulosities VDB 1 and NGC 7023. The J = 2 --> 1/J = 1 --> 0 intensity ratio of (CO)-C-12 and (CO)-C-13 indicate kinetic temperatures of about 15 K and H-2 densities of 1-5 10(3) cm-3 for the bulk of the molecular cloud. Higher excitation temperatures are found towards the gas associated with the reflection nebulosity NGC 7023 and the border between the molecular cloud associated with LKH-alpha 198 and VDB1. Although massive star formation is not taking place in these regions and the masses of these clouds are approximately 10(3) M. the IR luminosity/mass ratios, approximately 5 L./M., are typical of very active star forming regions. The flux at 100-mu-m is correlated with the integrated intensity of the (CO)-C-13, but the slope of this correlation varies over the clouds. The values of the F(100-mu-m)/N(H) ratio, in units of MJy sr-1/10(20)cm-2, ranges from 1-2 for the bulk of the molecular cloud to values larger than 10 towards the reflection nebulosities, with intermediate values of 4-10 at the edges of the cloud. While the 60/100, 12/25 and 12/100 flux ratios increase towards the reflection nebulosities, the 25/60 and 25/100 ratios decrease towards them. All these results obtained towards the reflection nebulosities, are explained by the effects of the UV radiation on the molecular gas and dust grains in these regions.

TI ANALYSIS OF CATALYTICALLY ENHANCED SOLAR ABSORPTION CHEMICAL REACTORS .2. PREDICTED CHARACTERISTICS OF A 100KW CHEMICAL REACTOR
SO JOURNAL OF SOLAR ENERGY ENGINEERING-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME
LA English
DT Article
ID heat-transfer
AB The CAtalytically Enhanced Solar Absorption Receiver (CAESAR) is a 100 kW(chemical) test reactor currently in operation. This type of high-temperature chemical reactor volumetrically absorbs concentrated solar energy throughout a catalytic porous absorber matrix volume, promoting heterogeneous reactions with fluid-phase reactant species flowing through the absorber. A numerical model of these reactors has been developed to provide guidance in the catalytic matrix design for CAESAR. In the CAESAR reactor, methane is reformed using carbon dioxide and a rhodium catalyst. In addition, the model is being used to evaluate both the reactor performance and test data. This paper presents the thermal and chemical characteristics of the reactor for varying incident solar flux, fluid mass flow, convective heat-transfer coefficient, solar and infrared extinction coefficients, and catalyst loading. Predicted CAESAR performance is based on a prototype absorber and anticipated operating conditions. Model results suggest the mass flux must be proportioned to the incident solar flux radial distribution to prevent unacceptably high local temperatures and to provide a reactor having more uniform exit conditions. Either the catalytic loading or geometric thickness of the absorber should be increased for conversion to approach equilibrium levels. Also, the optical density of the matrix (particularly at the sunlit side of the reactor) should be decreased to distribute solar energy more uniformly in depth and decrease matrix temperatures at the front of the absorber.

AB Infrared spectroscopy of Nova Herculis 1991 between 8 and 13 mum 80 days after maximum revealed a large featureless infrared excess that was caused by a shell of optically thin silicate dust. The lack of an identifiable continuum underlying the silicate feature suggests that the grain radii were smaller than about 0.8 mum. The absolute visual magnitude at maximum M(upsilon)(max) was -9.4, the extinction A(upsilon) was 1.7 mag, and the distance d was 3.4 kpc. From these we find that the mass of dust was 10(-7) M. and the bolometric luminosity at maximum was about 20 times the Eddington limit for a 1 M. white dwarf.

The 111, 222 and 333 integrated reflectivities from samples of CdTe with significantly different etch-pit densities were then measured and analyzed in light of this relationship. The integrated reflectivity measurements suggest that the crystals are of similar crystalline perfection, while the etch-pit densities imply that one crystal is much more perfect than the other. The apparent similarity of the two samples in the diffraction experiments is interpreted with respect to a linear dependence of the ratio R(dyn)/R(kin) on the parameter In mu-xi. This result is consistent with the defect structures of the crystals observed using X-ray topography.

TI A LOW EXTINCTION RATE OF INTERMEDIATE-WATER BENTHIC FORAMINIFERA AT THE CRETACEOUS TERTIARY BOUNDARY

AB The contrast between the high extinction rates of calcareous marine plankton and low extinction rates of deep-water calcareous benthic foraminifera across the Cretaceous/Tertiary (K/T) boundary is now recognized. However, the water depth at which the vertical change in extinction rates of marine organisms occurred at the K/T boundary is not yet known because of the lack of data on the extinction rates of intermediate-water organisms. The extinction rate of intermediate-water benthic foraminiferal species from Kawaruppu, Hokkaido, Japan, was determined by distinguishing locally extinct species. A distinctly low extinction rate (10%) for calcareous benthic foraminiferal fauna from the upper part of the intermediate-water is documented for the first time. This rate is almost equal to the extinction rate of deep-water benthic foraminifera (approximately 10%) and is much smaller than the planktic foraminiferal extinction rate (81%). The extinction rate curve for calcareous foraminifera in a vertical water column indicates that a rapid change from a high extinction rate (approximately 80%) to a low extinction rate (approximately 10%) took place at a water depth of about 150 m. This depth of change is equivalent to the boundary depth between the surface and intermediate waters and between the euphotic and aphotic zones. Furthermore, this coincidence is consistent with the hypothesis that acid rain and a darkness-induced breakdown of the marine food-chain, produced by a cometary or asteroidal impact at the K/T boundary, were the main causes of the mass extinction of calcareous planktic organisms in surface waters.

AB The description of Megaceros aenigmaticus Schust., briefly treated in Schuster (1992), is enhanced. Two phenotypes (both lacking visible gametangia) were collected in 1952: a) a weakly to moderately frilled-margined, closely pinnatifid to pinnate phase and b) an entire-margined phase, often remotely 2-3-pinnate, with very narrow ultimate pinnae, mimicking a large Riccardia multifida or R. chamedryfolia. Both phases had only solitary chloroplasts of dorsal epidermal cells. It was tentatively concluded that a distinct species of Anthoceros was at hand, the single chloroplasts seeming to exclude Megaceros (to which phase a bore some resemblances). Lack of gametangia and sporophytes precluded resolution of both generic provenance and of whether one or two intermingled taxa were at hand, the plant has remained "in limbo " for forty years. A preliminary account by Renzaglia and Hicks (1984) of a third phenotype appeared: c) a female phase with frilled thallus margins, bearing 1-4 epidermal chloroplasts per cell. The question arose. are these phases members of one species, and to what genus do they belong? In October 1987, mass collections were made in order to find male plants and sporophytes and to try to resolve whether all these enigmatic plants belonged to one or more species. Among thousands of plants collected from several stations, a fourth phenotype was found: d) vigorous female plants with strikingly lobulate-laciniate and crispulate thallus margins, with dorsal epidermal cells with either paired or single dumbbell-shaped chloroplasts. This variability-from Anthoceros-like to Megaceros-like epidermal cells-and gross variability in four other criteria: a) development, or lack thereof of endogenous slime cells, b) presence or absence of Nostoc symbionts; c) number of cells delimiting the mouth of the archegonium; and d) number of cells peripheral to the ventral gametophytic stomata, are subject to in-depth investigation. It is concluded that a single, strikingly malleable species of Megaceros is at hand, differing from all well-known taxa of that primarily antipodal genus in being unisexual and relying on fragmentation and regenerant-formation for its dispersal. The assumption is documented that reduction to sterile and purely female clonal populations, isolated in limited environments in western North Carolina to South Carolina, along small rills, is probably a recent (surely post-Oligocene, perhaps post-Pliocene) phenomenon. Extinction of the male sex is shown to be matched in a number of other cases in the Appalachian system.

AB We have made airborne measurements of spectral optical depths, radiative fluxes, and scattered radiation fields during the NASA Caribbean mission (July 7-14, 1991) to characterize the Pinatubo volcanic cloud. In this paper we report the latitudinal and spectral dependence of the volcanic cloud's optical depth. From these measurements we determine moments of the particle size distribution. The change in planetary albedo induced by the volcanic cloud is calculated for the range of measured optical depths with the objective of assessing the impact on the solar radiation budget. Mid-visible optical depths higher than 0.4 were observed, placing the Pinatubo stratospheric cloud among the thickest ever measured. The latitudinal distribution of extinction shows that by July 7, 1991 the volcanic cloud had extended to 30-degrees-N. The effective particle radius was determined to be between 0.18-mu-m and 0.35-mu-m with a corresponding columnar mass loading between 35 and 80 mg.m-2.

AB We present near infrared photometric data which identify the embedded low-luminosity object SSV 13 (HH 71 11 IRS) as a variable. At 2.2-mu-m, the source has recently brightened by as much as about one magnitude within only one year. The accompanying changes in colour are not directly compatible with those expected from observed interstellar extinction curves. Whereas the observed source spectrum at any one instant cannot be represented by a single-temperature blackbody, the distribution of the surplus flux in the bright state is well fit by a single blackbody emitter. The temperature, the characteristic length scale and the luminosity of the observed blackbody are T approximately 1150 K, 2R approximately 5 10(12) cm (0.3 AU) and DELTA-L approximately 2L., which corresponds to about 2% of the bolometric luminosity of the system. The available data are not well explained in terms of a relatively warm, isothermal protostellar companion. A model in which the variations reflect thermal instabilities in the circumstellar disk of SSV 13, caused by variable mass accretion, has greater potential in accounting for the observed colour-magnitude variations.

TI AN INFRARED SUPERSHELL SURROUNDING THE CYGNUS OB1 ASSOCIATION

AB Using IRAS Skyflux images and a new catalog of OB stars in the Cygnus region, we have identified a complete infrared supershell surrounding the Cyg OB1 association. This supershell is seen as a conspicuous and well-defined 2-degrees x 5-degrees region deficient of IR emission, with a limb-brightened edge and dimensions of about 50 x 130 pc at 1.5 kpc. We present IRAS Skyflux images of the supershell along with color-corrected fluxes of the shell's limb-brightened edge. These fluxes, together with a two-temperature grain emission model, allow us to estimate the shell's dust temperature range, infrared luminosity, and total mass of gas and dust. The shell's elongated morphology is consistent with OB-star subclustering over the approximately 10(6) yr age of the bubble. With a parent star cluster still visible (10 O stars between 25 and 45 M., three to four Wolf-Rayet stars, and the possibility of three to five more massive stars that died as supernovae), the Cyg OB1 supershell is an excellent object for studying the formation and evolution of Galactic supershells. A discrepancy between the less-than-or-equal-to 1 Myr bubble age estimated from its size and the 5 Myr cluster turnoff age may require noncoeval massive star formation to explain the number of post-main-sequence stars and limit the number of past supernovae.

AB A lactococcal bacteriocin, termed lactococcin G, was purified to homogeneity by a simple four-step purification procedure that includes ammonium sulfate precipitation, binding to a cation exchanger and octyl-Sepharose CL-4B, and reverse-phase chromatography. The final yield was about 20%, and nearly a 7,000-fold increase in the specific activity was obtained. The bacteriocin activity was associated with three peptides, termed alpha-1, alpha-2, and beta, which were separated by reverse-phase chromatography. Judging from their amino acid sequences, alpha-1, and alpha-2 were the same gene product. Differences in their configurations presumably resulted in alpha-2 having a slightly lower affinity for the reverse-phase column than alpha-1, and a reduced bacteriocin activity when combined with beta. Bacteriocin activity required the complementary action of both the alpha and the beta-peptides. When neither alpha-1, nor beta was in excess, about 0.3 nM alpha-1 and 0.04 nM beta-induced 50% growth inhibition, suggesting that they might interact in a 7:1 or 8:1 ratio. As judged by the amino acid sequence, alpha-1, has an isoelectric point of 10.9, an extinction coefficient of 1.3 x 10(4) M-1 cm-1, and a molecular weight of 4,346 (39 amino acid residues long). Similarly, beta has an isoelectric point of 10.4, an extinction coefficient of 2.4 x 10(4) M-1 cm-1, and a molecular weight of 4110 (35 amino acid residues long). Molecular weights of 4,376 and 4,109 for alpha-1, and beta, respectively, were obtained by mass spectrometry. The N-terminal halves of both the alpha and the 13 peptides may form amphiphilic alpha-helices, suggesting that the peptides are pore-forming toxins that create cell membrane channels through a "barrel-stave" mechanism. The C-terminal halves of both peptides consist largely of polar amino acids.

AB We report the first images obtained with the Goddard Fabry-Perot imager, a very sensitive and tunable imaging system designed to achieve the high levels of performance required in the optical studies of faint emission-line extragalactic objects. A velocity sequence of calibrated narrow-band CCD images (FWHM approximately 7 angstrom) has been obtained to cover the 3000 km s-1 velocity space between the redshifted H-alpha-emission lines of NGC 1275 (the central dominant galaxy of the Perseus Cluster), its extended associated system of low-velocity (LV) filaments and the high-velocity (HV) system of knots, projected on the same line of sight in the sky. The lack of intermediate-velocity emission-line gas between the two systems leads to an upper limit of 1.5 x 10(-16) ergs cm-2 s-1 arcsec-2 (3-sigma) on stripped ionized gas due to dynamical interaction between NGC 1275 and its high-velocity companion galaxy.  It also confirms the previous reports that the level of continuum light arising from stellar or nonstellar sources must be very low in otherwise bright, strongly concentrated emission-line knots with unresolved diameters of 425 h-1 pc.  The two galaxies are well separated kinematically. We have measured the H-alpha-luminosities of the emission-line regions of the two systems and have derived star formation rates in order to investigate quantitatively the physical relation between the HV galaxy, NGC 1275, and the surrounding cooling flow filaments.  We found that the 3' diameter region around NGC 1275 has a total observed H-alpha-luminosity of 5 x 10(41) h-2 ergs s-1, a factor of 2.5 lower than a currently popular value (based on 1983 data).  On the other hand, our measurements of central regions match other published values.  Implications of this new measurement are discussed in the context of cooling flows. Corrected for Galactic foreground absorption, the H-alpha-luminosity of NGC 1275 of L(G)(H-alpha) approximately 1.2 x 1.2 x 10(42) h-2 ergs s-1 is comparable to those of other strong cooling flows.  A normal initial mass function (IMF) for star formation in NGC 1275 is consistent with published X-ray, UV, and optical data in this paper.  In particular, the revised H-alpha-luminosity of a strong emission-line extranuclear region can be reconciled with the limit on its continuum UV flux at 1250 angstrom; therefore, the exclusion of stars more massive than 25 M. is no longer needed.  Also, the hypothesis of a low-mass cutoff to the IMF at 2 M., which had been introduced to reconcile the star formation rate (SFR) derived from the H-alpha-luminosity with the mass deposition rate of X-ray gas (M(x)), is not needed when the revised value SFR approximately 10 h-2 M. yr-1 is compared with the similar value M(x) approximately 7.5-15 h-2 M. yr-1 within the 30" radius central region. In the HV galaxy, the H-alpha-luminosities of 13 regions have been measured in six narrow-band images, leading to a total observed luminosity L(H-alpha) = 7.2 x 10(40) h-2 ergs s-1 over a surface area of 877 arcsec2.  The star formation rate SFR approximately 1 h-2 M. yr-1 corresponds to a total stellar mass of 12 x 10(6) h-2 M. if massive stars ionize the H-alpha-knots.  The collision of gas clouds in a heterogeneous intracluster medium with the fast-moving HV galaxy has been modeled.  Following the collision, the HV interstellar medium becomes violently perturbed, with giant expanding cavities sweeping considerable masses of gas.  Star formation with a 2-4 h-2 % efficiency in the HV shocked disk supershells may occur under favorable conditions 1-8 Myr after the collision event.

TI CONDENSATION OF DUST AROUND THE WOLF-RAYET STAR WR 125

AB Infrared photometry of the WC7-type Wolf-Rayet star WR 125 (MR 93) in 1981-91 shows a 10-fold rise in the 3-4 mum flux during 1990-91. This, together with observations at longer wavelengths, is interpreted in terms of the condensation of dust in its wind, similar to the events observed from episodic dust-making WR stars like WR 48a in 1979-80 and WR 140 in 1977 and 1985. Dust condensation started in 1990.6 and has continued for at least a year at a rate of 2.3 x 10(-7) M. yr-1, about 0.4 per cent of the mass-loss rate. The pre-condensation photometry of its stellar wind indicates that WR 125 is 3.5 times as distant as WR 140, namely 4.7 kpc away. Radio observations at 2, 6 and 20 cm in 1985 are modelled in terms of a component from the stellar wind and an embedded non-thermal source of intrinsic spectrum S(nu) is-proportional-to nu--0.6 and suffering circumstellar extinction. Reobservation of the 6-cm flux in 1988 showed that this had fallen significantly to a level little more than the free-free emission from the stellar wind, indicating severe attenuation of the non-thermal source. The optical emission-line spectrum of WR 125 is diluted almost as much as that of WR 140, presumably by the continuum of a hot companion, although we have been unable to find any absorption lines from it in the lambdalambda4370-4770 region. From the profile of the He I 1.083-mum line in our infrared spectrum, a wind velocity of 2900 km s-1 is determined, similar to that of WR 140, suggesting that the new dust shell will be dissipated on a time-scale (approximately 4 yr) comparable to that of WR 140.

AB A catastrophic terminal Triassic extinction event among terrestrial vertebrates is not supported by available evidence. The current model for such an extinction is based on at least eight weak or untenable assumptions: (1) a terminal Triassic extinction-inducing asteroid impact occurred, (2) a terminal Triassic synchronous mass extinction of terrestrial vertebrates occurred, (3) a concurrent terminal Triassic marine extinction occurred. (4) all terrestrial vertebrate families have similar diversities and ecologies, (5) changes in familial diversity can be gauged accurately from the known fossil record, (6) extinction of families can be compared through time without normalizing for changes in familial diversity through time. (7) extinction rates can be compared without normalizing for differing lengths of geologic stages, and (8) catastrophic mass extinctions do not select for small size. These assumptions have resulted in unsupportable and (or) erroneous conclusions. Carboniferous through Early Jurassic terrestrial vertebrate families mostly have evolution and extinction patterns unlike the vertebrate evolution and extinction patterns during the terminal Cretaceous event. Only the Serpukhovian (mid Carboniferous) extinction event shows strong analogy to the terminal Cretaceous event. Available data suggest no terminal Triassic extinction anomaly, but rather a prolonged and nearly steady decline in the global terrestrial vertebrate extinction rate throughout the Triassic and earliest Jurassic.

AB Far-infrared spectra from 20 mum (500 cm-1) to 100 mum (100 cm-1) of water ice have been measured over the temperature range of 13-155 K. Amorphous and crystalline water ice are easily identified in far-infrared spectra since amorphous ice has one broad absorption peak near 45 mum (220 cm-1) and crystalline has absorptions near 44 mum (229 cm-1) and 62 mum (162 cm-1). We have observed radiation-induced phase changes in both amorphous and crystalline ice. Crystalline ice converts to an amorphous phase when irradiated at temperatures between 77 and 13 K. The conversion rate increases as the temperature is decreased and the converted fraction is dose dependent. No radiation-induced changes are detected in amorphous ice between 125 and 36 K. However, far-infrared spectra of proton-irradiated ices near 13 K show interconversion between the amorphous and crystalline ice phases beginning at doses near 2 eV molecule-1 and continuing cyclically with increased dose. A quadrupole mass spectrometer was used to detect H-2, H2O, and 02 releases associated with the cyclic phase conversions. Radiation-induced phase changes in these two forms will be discussed in relation to interstellar ices, and ices in comets.

AB Variations in the influx rate of incoming Oort cloud comets, leading to the occurrence of comet showers, are reviewed with special emphasis on the dynamical processes that produce them. It is found that comet showers as intense as 10-100 times the background comet flux may occur at average intervals of several 10(7) years, being very close stellar passages at distances almost-equal-to 10(4) AU and, perhaps, penetrating encounters with intermediate-size molecular clouds the trigger mechanisms. Penetrating encounters with giant molecular clouds and stellar passages at distances of a few 10(3) AU may trigger comet showers about 10(2) - -10(3) times more intense than the background comet flux at average intervals of a few 10(8) years. The impact cratering record on the Earth does not show any clear evidence of past comet showers. Some orbital properties of new and dynamically young comets suggest that the influx rate of Oort cloud comets is currently near its background level.

AB THE discovery of high concentrations of iridium in Cretaceous/Tertiary boundary sediments engendered the hypothesis1 that a meteorite collided with the Earth 65 million years ago, coincident with the mass extinction that occurred at that time. Iridium spikes of various magnitudes have subsequently been reported at more than 10 other extinction horizons2-11. It has been suggested, on the other hand, that geochemical processes might create or modify many of these spikes5,11-14, but a critical evaluation of these suggestions has been hindered by incomplete understanding of low-temperature iridium geochemistry. Other platinum-group elements (Ru, Rh, Pd, Re, Os, Pt, Au) are often found to be associated with Ir spikes, and inter-element ratios have been used to assess the cosmic or terrestrial nature of the enrichments5,7,9,28,29; but the geochemical influences on these relative abundances are also poorly constrained. Here we describe analyses of recent abyssal marine sediments which allow us to characterize the behaviour of Pt, Re and Ir during early diagenesis. These elements are redistributed by changes in sedimentary redox conditions. Such changes can probably account for many of the small platinum-group-element spikes found in the geological record, and may render ambiguous attempts to interpret interelement ratios.

AB We use published photometry and new emission-line data to compare the IR luminosity excesses and Ca II triplet line strengths in a sample of 85 T Tauri and Herbig Ae/Be stars. We also examine the extinction-corrected spectral energy distributions and estimate the radii and luminosities of the underlying stars. Our main results are the following; (1) The spectra of several sources suggest that much of the visible flux is reflected by dust. The blue colors caused by reflection lead to underestimated extinctions (by at least approximately 1-4 mag at V) and stellar luminosities (by factors of at least approximately 2-40). (2) The excess infrared (1.0-25-mu-m) luminosities (L(IRE)) are typically larger in the high-mass sources, but are smaller relative to their stellar bolometric luminosities (L*). (3) The large ratios L(IRE)/L* greater than or similar to 1 in many of the T Tauri stars and a few of the cooler Herbig stars require that some of the IR flux originate from stellar companions or self-luminous accretion disks. The examples of T Tau and XZ Tau demonstrate the possible large contributions from IR companion stars. (4) The B-type Herbig stars all have small L(IRE)/L* ratios that are consistent with passive reprocessing disks. Small ratios also appear in the two luminous embedded young stars we consider, GL 490 and S106 IRS 3. (5) The hottest (early B) sources have the lowest L(IRE)/L* ratios, suggesting a lower efficiency for reprocessing the starlight. The reduced efficiency could be due to the intense ionizing radiation clearing the inner disks of absorbers (i.e., dust). (6) The IR excess and Ca II triplet line luminosities are roughly correlated across the entire sample (approximately 5 decades in luminosity). (7) Among the T Tauri stars the correlation is stronger than the relationship with L* and is consistent with both the lines and IR continuum being driven by accretion disks. (8) Among the Herbig stars the Ca II-L(IRE) correlation could result from accretion in some objects and reprocessing in others. Two classical Be stars, gamma-Cas and theta-Per, are used to show that the correlation can be met even when accretion is clearly not a factor. (9) Whatever excitation is involved, the existence of a Ca II-L(IRE) relationship suggests that the line-emitting envelopes are somehow related to (or perhaps contingent upon) the presence of disks. The correlation therefore argues against the stellar-driven (e.g., chromospheric) interpretation of the lines.

TI IRIDIUM ABUNDANCE MAXIMA AT THE LATEST ORDOVICIAN MASS EXTINCTION HORIZON, YANGTZE BASIN, CHINA - TERRESTRIAL OR EXTRATERRESTRIAL
SO GEOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
ID silurian boundary; stratigraphy; consequences; stratotype
AB Neutron activation analyses of the Chinese Ordovician/Silurian (O/S) boundary sections at two distant localities in the Yangtze Basin, spanning the horizon of a major latest Ordovician global extinction event, show the maxima of iridium abundances to be coincident with the extinction horizon at the base of the graptolite Glyptograptus persculptus zone. The 0.23 ppb Ir maximum in the Yichang type section is almost as large as the late Eocene impact Ir anomaly. However, we have observed that the tr abundances in the Chinese sections are closely correlated with the sedimentation rates, and we therefore have concluded that the Ir maxima do not indicate a cataclysmic extraterrestrial impact at this extinction level.

TI EVOLUTIONARY RADIATION OF MICROPERFORATE PLANKTONIC-FORAMINIFERA FOLLOWING THE K/T MASS EXTINCTION EVENT
SO JOURNAL OF FORAMINIFERAL RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
ID cretaceous tertiary boundary; alabama; paleoecology; turnover; braggs
AB Well preserved earliest Pateocene planktonic foraminiferal assemblages from Millers Ferry, Alabama, provide evidence that all early Paleocene microperforate planktonic foraminifera are derived from Guembelitria cretacea, a K/T mass extinction survivor species. In the Late Cretaceous (Maestrichtian), G. cretacea was a neritoplanktonic species restricted to continental margin environments. In the lowest Pateocene, G. cretacea is the only Cretaceous species that does not decline in abundance. Abundance change and range of Late Cretaceous species in the lower Paleocene at different localities suggest that specimens of all other Cretaceous species (except Hedbergella monmouthensis and H. holmdelensis which range into the lowermost Pateocene P0 Zone at Millers Ferry) are reworked fractions. Abundance change and range of Late Cretaceous species in the tower Pateocene at different locatities contrasts with Keller's (1988, 1989) stepwise extinction pattern and survivorship of certain Cretaceous species. During deposition of the P0 and Palpha Zones in the early Paleocene, Guembelitria cretacea invaded the open oceans and rapidly gave rise to several neritoplanktonic and pelagic genera and species. The evolution and dominance of microperforate species during the earliest Paleocene suggests that the loss of Late Cretaceous planktonic foraminiferal species during the K/T mass extinction was extremely heavy and that pelagic habitats were nearly vacated. In addition, the rapid decline of the microperforate species group during the proliferation of cancellate globigerine forms suggests that the evolution of the microperforate planktonic foraminifera was a rapid evolutionary adaptive radiation into vacated pelagic paleohabitats. Four evolutionary lineages are recognized in the monophyletic early Paleocene microperforate plexus: (1) Woodringina hornerstownensis and biserial Chiloguembelina derived independently from triserial G. cretacea through Woodringina claytonensis; (2) Globoconusa daubjergensis evolved directly from G. cretacea by an alteration of a triserial to a trochospiral test along with modification of pore-mounded walls to spine-like sharp pustulose walls; (3) a new species, Guembelitria? alabamensis Liu and Olsson, evolves from G. cretacea by development of a trochospiral test but with little modification of wall texture; (4) various morphotypes of Parvularugoglobigerina eugubina are linked to G. cretacea by the earliest Paleocene morphotype Parvularugoglobigerina aff. eugubina.

AB A temporary and drastic increase in S-34/S-32 ratio of whole rock sulfide has been recognized just at the Cretaceous/Tertiary boundary within the continuous marine sedimentary sequence of the Kawaruppu section in eastern Hokkaido. Japan: the apparent extent of fractionation, with respect to inferred contemporaneous seawater sulfate, in the anomaly zone which includes the ''boundary claystone'' at the bottom lies in the range of - 25 +/- 10 parts per thousand., whereas that in the lower and upper siltstone strata is roughly twice as much, giving the values in the range of - 49 +/- 10 parts per thousand. The former is quantitatively equivalent in magnitude with the range of kinetic isotope effect in bacterial dissimilatory sulfate reduction and the latter with the typical variation range as observed in sedimentary-diagenetic sulfides in ordinary oxic marine basins. The present data would strongly support the temporary occurrence of an aerobe-free, anoxic, oceanic sedimentary environment beginning just at the Cretaceous/Tertiary boundary and continuing for approximately 70,000 years, probably as a consequence of a certain catastrophic event responsible for the terminal Cretaceous mass extinction.

TI DID THE MANICOUAGAN IMPACT TRIGGER END-OF-TRIASSIC MASS EXTINCTION
SO GEOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
ID north mountain basalt; nova-scotia; isochron age; quebec; melt; stratigraphy; zircon; canada; dates; flows
AB We use U-Pb zircon dating to test whether the bolide impact that created the Manicouagan crater of Quebec also triggered mass extinction at the Triassic/Jurassic boundary. ne age of the impact is provided by zircons from the impact melt rock on the crater floor; we show that the zircons yield a U-Pb age of 214 +/- 1 Ma. The age of the Triassic/Jurassic boundary is provided by zircons from the North Mountain Basalt of the Newark Supergroup of Nova Scotia; the zircons yield a U-Pb age of 202 +/- 1 Ma. This should be the age of the end-of-Triassic mass extinction that paleontology and sedimentation rates suggest occurred less than 1 m.y. before extrusion of the North Mountain Basalt. Although the Manicouagan impact could thus not have triggered the mass extinction at the Triassic/Jurassic boundary (impact likely having preceded extinction by 12 +/- 2 m.y.), the impact may possibly have triggered an earlier mass extinction at the Carnian/Norian boundary in the Late Triassic.

TI FLAME PROPAGATION IN A HORIZONTAL CHANNEL WITH COLD SIDE WALLS IN A GRAVITATIONAL-FIELD
SO COMBUSTION EXPLOSION AND SHOCK WAVES
LA English
DT Article
AB The propagation of a laminar flame in a plane closed horizontal channel with cold walls in a gravitational field is investigated by numerical integration of the two-dimensional nonsteady equations describing the motion of reacting gas. It is shown that the laws of combustion depend significantly on the external mass force; in near-limiting mixtures, layer-by-layer combustion of the fuel mixture is possible. Critical values of the Fourier number separating regions of combustion and extinction are found. An approximate solution of the model problem of flame propagation close to a cold wall is obtained.

TI MICROTEKTITES AND MASS EXTINCTIONS - EVIDENCE FOR A LATE DEVONIAN ASTEROID IMPACT
SO SCIENCE
LA English
DT Article
ID tektites; geochemistry
AB Glass spherules, similar to microtektites, have been found near the Frasnian-Famennian boundary (F/F) (Upper Devonian) at Senzeilles, Belgium, contemporaneous with one of the largest marine mass extinctions of the Phanerozoic. These spherules exhibit a wide range of compositions and display teardrop, dumbbell, and compound morphologies analogous to microtektites. In addition, they lack crystallites, have few or no vesicles, and have a low content of volatile material. These characteristics are supportive of an impact origin. The Siljan Ring (Sweden) and Charlevoix structure (Quebec, Canada) are candidate craters of this age. The presence of microtektites near the F/F boundary supports the hypothesis that an impact caused the Upper Devonian worldwide benthic mass extinctions.

ID large magellanic cloud; h-ii-regions; massive stars; observational tests; evolutionary models; large telescopes; o stars; catalog; extinction; starburst
AB We have obtained long-slit optical spectra of 10 Wolf-Rayet galaxies and four other starburst galaxies. Using the nebular emission lines we have determined the electron temperatures, electron densities, extinctions, oxygen abundances, mass of ionized hydrogen, and numbers of ionizing photons due to hot stars in these galaxies. The various forbidden line ratios clearly indicate a stellar origin for the emission-line spectrum. From the flux of the broad He II lambda4686 emission feature we have estimated the number of Wolf-Rayet stars present. We have accounted for the contribution of these stars to the total ionizing flux and have calculated the ratio of the number of these stars to the number of O stars. In most of the Wolf-Rayet galaxies the number ratios are an order of magnitude larger than those predicted by current models of stellar evolution under conditions of continuous star formation lasting 10(7) yr or longer. The observed number ratios can be reconciled with the model predictions only if the star formation episodes occur in short bursts with durations of 10(6) yr or less. Wolf-Rayet galaxies are therefore among the youngest examples of the starburst phenomenon, which we observed at a proptitious moment.

TI THE BEHAVIOR OF SUPERPROCESSES NEAR EXTINCTION
SO ANNALS OF PROBABILITY

DT Article
DE SUPERPROCESS; MEASURE VALUED; TANAKA FORMULA
ID partial-differential equations; super-brownian motion; diffusions
AB In this paper we use a martingale problem characterization to study the behavior of finite measure valued superprocesses with a variety of spatial motions. In general the superprocess, when normalized to be a probability, will converge to a point mass at its extinction time. For some spatial motions we prove that there are times near extinction at which the closed support of the process is concentrated near one point. We obtain a Tanaka formula for the measure of a half space under a one dimensional symmetric stable superprocess of index a and we show this process fails to be a semimartingale if 1 < alpha < 2.

AB Using the observed data of galaxies at 60, 100, 345, and 761 mum, we present a simple and systematic way to examine the uncertainties in the determination of dust mass owing to uncertainties in the dust emissivity law, imprecision in the observed data, inexact modeling of the temperature distribution, and the presence of a correlation between grain size and temperature. Our results for 12 galaxies generally confirm conclusions reached in previous works. They show that while emission by warm dust at a single temperature can account for the spectra at lambda greater than or similar to 60 mum of a large number of galaxies in our sample when observational uncertainties are taken into account and with the freedom of choice of emissivity law, temperature distributions with large amounts of cold dust can fit the data better. To reduce the large uncertainties in the dust mass determination, observations at long submillimeter wavelengths (lambda greater-than-or-equal-to 761 mum) are crucial in order to narrow down the possible range of emissivity law, and highly accurate S100 mum/S345 mum and S100 mum/S761 mum flux density ratios are needed. With the presently available data for the 12 galaxies, our best estimates for the ratios of infrared luminosity to gas mass range from 2 to 23 and average 9.

AB We have obtained near-infrared images of a large sample of interacting galaxies selected from the Atlas of Peculiar Galaxies by Arp. Approximately 180 systems have been imaged in at least two, and usually three of the standard JHK bands. Here we describe the survey and the observing and data reduction procedures, and present contour plots and aperture photometry. Future papers will analyze the imaging data by groupings based on interaction type, stage, and progenitors. The goals of the analysis are to explore the relationships between galaxy interactions, activity, and morphology by studying the structure of the near-infrared luminosity distribution, where extinction effects are much reduced relative to the optical and the major stellar mass component of galaxies dominates the observed light.

AB An assumption inherent to most models of dust-driven winds from cool, evolved stars is that the radiative and collisional drag forces acting on an individual dust grain are in balance throughout the flow. We have checked the validity of this supposition of "complete momentum coupling" by comparing the grain motion obtained from such a model with that derived from solution of the full (i.e., including inertia) grain equation of motion. For physical conditions typical of the circumstellar envelopes of oxygen-rich red giants, we find that silicate grains with initial radii smaller than about 5 x 10(-6) cm decouple from the ambient gas near the base of the outflow. The implications of these results for models of dust-driven mass loss from late-type giants and supergiants are discussed.

AB An analysis of the final stratigraphic appearances of byrozoan species and genera, compiled in a world-wide bryozoan data base, revealed three discrete Late Ordovician extinctions.  A Late Caradoc (Onnian) extinction was most pronounced on the plates of Baltica and Siberia.  Endemic species and genera, confined to one plate and one lithotope were most affected and the extinction was coincident with increased migrations of bryozoan genera to Baltica and Siberia.  The Late Caradoc extinction may be related to decreasing provinciality and competition between migrant and stenotopic taxa.  Two major extinctions occurred in the Late Ashgill.  The greatest of the two is recognized at the end of the Rawtheyan, and affected primarily taxa on the North American plate.  The extinction at the end of the Hirnantian affected primarily Baltic taxa.  The exact timing of the end-Rawtheyan extinction in North America cannot be established owing to incompleteness of the stratigraphic record.  The Rawtheyan extinction occurred during a major glaciation centered in North Africa and a regression of epeiric seas.  The large majority of North American survivors of the extinction are represented by faunas preserved on Anticosti Island, which remained submerged during the regression.  This evidence supports regression as a cause of the Rawtheyan extinctions in North America.  The end-Hirnantian extinctions may be related to the ensuing transgression or to a wave of faunal migrations associated with the transgression.

AB The interaction of density and mycorrhizal effects on the growth, mineral nutrition and size distribution of seedlings of two perennial members of the Fabaceae was investigated in pot culture. Seedlings of Otholobium hirtum and Aspalathus linearis were grown at densities of 1, 4, 8 and 16 plants per 13-cm pot with or without vesicular-arbuscular (VA) mycorrhizal inoculum for 120 days. Plant mass, relative growth rates, height and leaf number all decreased with increasing plant density. This was ascribed to the decreasing availability of phosphorus per plant as density increased. O. hirtum was highly dependent on mycorrhizas for P uptake but both mycorrhizal and non-mycorrhizal A. linearis seedlings were able to extract soil P with equal ease. Plant size distribution as measured by the coefficient of variation (CV) of shoot mass was greater at higher densities. CVs of mycorrhizal O. hirtum plants were higher than those of non-mycorrhizal plants. CVs of the facultatively mycorrhizal A. linearis were similar for both mycorrhizal and non-mycorrhizal plants. Higher CVs are attributed to resource preemption by larger individuals. Individuals in populations with high CVs will probably survive stress which would result in the extinction of populations with low CVs. Mass of mycorrhizal plants of both species decreased more rapidly with increasing density than did non-mycorrhizal plant mass. It is concluded that the cost of being mycorrhizal increases as plant density increases, while the benefit decreases. The results suggest that mycorrhizas will influence density-dependent population processes of facultative and obligate mycorrhizal species.
