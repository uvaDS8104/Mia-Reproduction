AB Taxa differ widely in numbers of species, which may be due either to chance alone  or to factors that cause differences in speciation and extinction rates between  taxa. To test whether an observed distribution of species over taxa differs from  the distribution expected from chance alone, one must take into account that  neither speciation nor extinction rates are known. This paper introduces a way to  estimate speciation and extinction probabilities from the distribution of extant  species over families and to test whether the observed distribution is different  from expected. Application of this procedure to the distributions of bird,  hexapod, primate, and angiosperm species over taxa provides statistical evidence  of differences in rates of cladogenesis between taxa.

TI Taxonomic level as a determinant of the shape of the Phanerozoic marine
SO The American naturalist
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB Key aims of recent paleobiological research have been the construction of  Phanerozoic global biodiversity patterns and the formulation of models and  mechanisms of diversification describing such patterns. Two conflicting theories  of global diversification have been equilibrium versus expansionist growth of  taxonomic diversity. These models, however, rely on accurate empirical data  curves, and it is not clear to what extent the taxonomic level at which the data  are analyzed controls the resulting pattern. Global Phanerozoic marine diversity  curves are constructed at ordinal, familial, and generic levels using several  fossil-range data sets. The fit of a single logistic model reduces from ordinal  through familial to generic level, while conversely, that of an exponential  growth model increases. Three sequential logistic equations, fitted to three time  periods during which diversity appears to approach or reach an equilibrium state,  provide the best description of the data at familial and generic levels. However,  an exponential growth curve describes the diversification of marine life since  the end-Permian extinction equally as well as a logistic. A species-level model  of global Phanerozoic marine diversification, constructed by extrapolation of the  trends from familial to generic level, suggests growth in numbers of marine  species was broadly exponential. When smaller subsets of the data are analyzed,  the effect of taxonomic level on the shape of the diversity curve becomes more  pronounced. In the absence of species data, a consistent signal at more than one  higher taxonomic level is required to predict a species-level pattern.

TI Toward a mechanistic understanding and prediction of biotic homogenization.
SO The American naturalist
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB The widespread replacement of native species with cosmopolitan, nonnative species  is homogenizing the global fauna and flora. While the empirical study of biotic  homogenization is substantial and growing, theoretical aspects have yet to be  explored. Consequently, the breadth of possible ecological mechanisms that can  shape current and future patterns and rates of homogenization remain largely  unknown. Here, we develop a conceptual model that describes 14 potential  scenarios by which species invasions and/or extinctions can lead to various  trajectories of biotic homogenization (increased community similarity) or  differentiation (decreased community similarity); we then use a simulation  approach to explore the model's predictions. We found changes in community  similarity to vary with the type and number of nonnative and native species, the  historical degree of similarity among the communities, and, to a lesser degree,  the richness of the recipient communities. Homogenization is greatest when  similar species invade communities, causing either no extinction or differential  extinction of native species. The model predictions are consistent with current  empirical data for fish, bird, and plant communities and therefore may represent  the dominant mechanisms of contemporary homogenization. We present a unifying  model illustrating how the balance between invading and extinct species dictates  the outcome of biotic homogenization. We conclude by discussing a number of  critical but largely unrecognized issues that bear on the empirical study of  biotic homogenization, including the importance of spatial scale, temporal scale,  and data resolution. We argue that the study of biotic homogenization needs to be  placed in a more mechanistic and predictive framework in order for studies to  provide adequate guidance in conservation efforts to maintain regional  distinctness of the global biota.

TI Evolution of cooperation: cooperation defeats defection in the cornfield model.
SO Journal of theoretical biology
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB "Cooperation" defines any behavior that enhances the fitness of a group (e.g. a  community or species), but which, by its nature, can be exploited by selfish  individuals, meaning, firstly, that selfish individuals derive an advantage from  exploitation which is greater than the average advantage that accrues to  unselfish individuals. Secondly, exploitation has no intrinsic fitness value  except in the presence of the "cooperative behavior". The mathematics is  described by the simple Prisoner's Dilemma Game (PDG). It has previously been  shown that koinophilia (the avoidance of sexual mates displaying unusual or  atypical phenotypic features, such as mutations) stabilizes any inherited  strategy in the simple or iterated PDG, meaning that it cannot be displaced by  rare forms of alternative behavior which arise through mutation or occasional  migration. In the present model equal numbers of cooperators and defectors (in  the simple PDG) were randomly spread in a two-dimensional "cornfield" with  uniformly distributed resources. Every individual was koinophilic, and interacted  (sexually and in the PDG tournaments) only with individuals from within its  immediate neighborhood. This model therefore tested whether cooperation can  outcompete defection or selfishness in a straight, initially equally matched,  evolutionary battle. The results show that in the absence of koinophilia  cooperation was rapidly driven to extinction. With koinophilia there was a very  rapid loss of cooperators in the first few generations, but thereafter  cooperation slowly spread, ultimately eliminating defection completely. This  result was critically dependent on sampling effects of neighborhoods. Small  samples (resulting from low population densities or small neighborhood sizes)  increase the probability that a chance neighborhood comes to consist  predominantly of cooperators. A sexual preference for the most common phenotype  in the neighborhood then makes that phenotype more common still. Once this occurs  cooperation's spread becomes almost inevitable.

TI Habitat fragmentation resulting in overgrazing by herbivores.
SO Journal of theoretical biology
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB Habitat fragmentation sometimes results in outbreaks of herbivorous insect and  causes an enormous loss of primary production. It is hypothesized that the  driving force behind such herbivore outbreaks is disruption of natural enemy  attack that releases herbivores from top-down control. To test this hypothesis I  studied how trophic community structure changes along a gradient of habitat  fragmentation level using spatially implicit and explicit models of a tri-trophic  (plant, herbivore and natural enemy) food chain. While in spatially implicit  model number of trophic levels gradually decreases with increasing fragmentation,  in spatially explicit model a relatively low level of habitat fragmentation leads  to overgrazing by herbivore to result in extinction of the plant population  followed by a total system collapse. This provides a theoretical support to the  hypothesis that habitat fragmentation can lead to overgrazing by herbivores and  suggests a central role of spatial structure in the influence of habitat  fragmentation on trophic communities. Further, the spatially explicit model shows  (i) that the total system collapse by the overgrazing can occur only if herbivore  colonization rate is high; (ii) that with increasing natural enemy colonization  rate, the fragmentation level that leads to the system collapse becomes higher,  and the frequency of the collapse is lowered.

TI Population on the verge of a mutational meltdown? Fitness costs of genetic load
SO Evolution; international journal of organic evolution
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB The fitness costs of high genetic load in wild populations have rarely been  assessed under natural conditions. Such costs are expected to be greatest in  small, bottlenecked populations, including those occurring near range edges.  Britain is at the northwesterly range limit of the natterjack toad Bufo calamita.  We compared fitness attributes in two populations of this amphibian with very  different recent histories. Key larval fitness attributes in B. calamita, notably  growth rate and metamorph production, were substantially higher in the large  outbreeding population (Ainsdale) than in the small and isolated one  (Saltfleetby). These differences were manifest under seminatural conditions, when  larvae were reared in mesh cages within breeding ponds at the site of the small  population, and were exacerbated by high stress treatments. The results indicate  that genetic load effects can be sufficiently severe enough to predispose  extinction over relatively short time frames, as predicted by extinction vortex  models.

TI Stability of forest biodiversity.
SO Nature
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB Two hypotheses to explain potentially high forest biodiversity have different  implications for the number and kinds of species that can coexist and the  potential loss of biodiversity in the absence of speciation. The first hypothesis  involves stabilizing mechanisms, which include tradeoffs between species in terms  of their capacities to disperse to sites where competition is weak, to exploit  abundant resources effectively and to compete for scarce resources. Stabilization  results because competitors thrive at different times and places. An alternative,  'neutral model' suggests that stabilizing mechanisms may be superfluous. This  explanation emphasizes 'equalizing' mechanisms, because competitive exclusion of  similar species is slow. Lack of ecologically relevant differences means that  abundances experience random 'neutral drift', with slow extinction. The relative  importance of these two mechanisms is unknown, because assumptions and  predictions involve broad temporal and spatial scales. Here we demonstrate that  predictions of neutral drift are testable using palaeodata. The results  demonstrate strong stabilizing forces. By contrast with the neutral prediction of  increasing variance among sites over time, we show that variances in post-Glacial  tree abundances among sites stabilize rapidly, and abundances remain coherent  over broad geographical scales.

TI Deterministic extinction effect of parasites on host populations.
SO Journal of mathematical biology
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB Experimental studies have shown that parasites can reduce host density and even  drive host population to extinction. Conventional mathematical models for  parasite-host interactions, while can address the host density reduction  scenario, fail to explain such deterministic extinction phenomena. In order to  understand the parasite induced host extinction, Ebert et al. (2000) formulated a  plausible but ad hoc epidemiological microparasite model and its stochastic  variation. The deterministic model, resembles a simple SI type model, predicts  the existence of a globally attractive positive steady state. Their simulation of  the stochastic model indicates that extinction of host is a likely outcome in  some parameter regions. A careful examination of their ad hoc model suggests an  alternative and plausible model assumption. With this modification, we show that  the revised parasite-host model can exhibit the observed parasite induced host  extinction. This finding strengthens and complements that of Ebert et al. (2000),  since all continuous models are likely break down when all population densities  are small. This extinction dynamics resembles that of ratio-dependent  predator-prey models. We report here a complete global study of the revised  parasite-host model. Biological implications and limitations of our findings are  also presented.

DT Journal Article
AB In this study, we assessed the effects of chronic prenatal ethanol exposure  (CPEE) on spatial navigation in the water maze, conditioned responding using  food-reinforced lever pressing, and amino acid neurotransmitter release from the  hippocampus of the adult guinea pig. Pregnant guinea pigs were treated with  ethanol (3 g/kg of maternal body weight/day), isocaloric-sucrose/pair-feeding, or  water throughout gestation. Adult offspring were trained in two-lever operant  chambers to respond for sucrose pellets, with one lever designated as the reward  lever. There were no group differences in response acquisition or lever  discrimination on a fixed-ratio 1 (FR-1) schedule. During extinction sessions,  CPEE offspring maintained higher levels of responding on the previously  reinforced lever, suggesting that CPEE increases perseveration and/or impairs  response inhibition but does not affect operant responding for an appetitive  reinforcer or the ability to discriminate rewarding from nonrewarding stimuli. In  contrast, there was no effect of CPEE on performance in the water maze in the  maternal ethanol regimen used in this study. CPEE did not alter electrically  evoked glutamate or GABA release from hippocampal brain slices. However, when  slices were tested after delivery of a tetanizing stimulation (five 5-s trains at  100 Hz), post-tetanic potentiation of electrically stimulated GABA release was  greater in hippocampal slices obtained from CPEE offspring, whereas post-tetanic  potentiation of electrically stimulated glutamate release was unaffected. These  data suggest that conditioned learning is a sensitive behavioral measure of  CPEE-induced brain injury. Increased activity-dependent potentiation of GABA  release in the hippocampus may contribute to alterations in synaptic plasticity  observed in CPEE offspring.

TI Valuing biodiversity: reality or mirage?

DT Journal Article
AB The objective of this paper was to consider the social value of biological  diversity and explore if this value could be expressed in terms of a  unidimensional metric in money. Economics distinguishes between use-values and  non-use-values, which are critically evaluated for valuing biodiversity. It is  shown that these utility-based valuations have severe limitations as they treat  species in isolation from their ecological contexts. In contrast, ecosystem  ecology regards ecosystems as an integrated non-linear and nonconvex system in  which ecosystem functions can be understood as a four-component cycle;  exploitation, accumulation of biomass, creative destruction and renewal. Within  such a cycle, ecosystems can be seen to have two properties: stability and  resilience. A good proxy for resilience is the probability of extinction of  species, and social value of biodiversity can be expressed as a partial ordering  with this probability as an index. This approach is consistent with decision  theory, of which social choice is an important component, pioneered by Arrow.

DT Journal Article
AB Ervatamia coronaria, a flowering plant (family Apocynaceae) indigenous to India,  has medicinally important applications. A search for biochemical constituents of  the latex of the plant yielded at least three thiol proteases with distinctly  different properties. One of them, a highly active protease (ervatamin A), was  purified to homogeneity by ion exchange and gel filtration chromatography. The  enzyme exhibited high proteolytic activity toward natural substrates and  amidolytic activity toward synthetic substrates. The pH and temperature optima  for proteolytic activity were 8-8.5 and 50-55 degrees C, respectively.  Proteolytic activity of the enzyme was strongly inhibited by thiol-specific  inhibitors. The estimated molecular mass of the enzyme was 27.6 kDa. The  extinction coefficient (epsilon(1%) 280) of the enzyme was estimated as 21.9, and  the protein molecule consists of 8 tryptophan, 11 tyrosine and 7 cysteine  residues. Isoelectric point of the purified enzyme was 8.37. Polyclonal  antibodies raised against the pure enzyme gave a single precipitin line in  Ouchterlony's double immunodiffusion and a typical color in ELISA. The N-terminal  sequence of the enzyme showed conserved amino acid residues to other plant  cysteine proteases. Ervatamin A shows high activity in relation to the other  thiol proteases isolated from the same source.

TI Sexual selection affects local extinction and turnover in bird communities.
SO Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB Predicting extinction risks has become a central goal for conservation and  evolutionary biologists interested in population and community dynamics. Several  factors have been put forward to explain risks of extinction, including  ecological and life history characteristics of individuals. For instance, factors  that affect the balance between natality and mortality can have profound effects  on population persistence. Sexual selection has been identified as one such  factor. Populations under strong sexual selection experience a number of costs  ranging from increased predation and parasitism to enhanced sensitivity to  environmental and demographic stochasticity. These findings have led to the  prediction that local extinction rates should be higher for speciespopulations  with intense sexual selection. We tested this prediction by analyzing the  dynamics of natural bird communities at a continental scale over a period of 21  years (1975-1996), using relevant statistical tools. In agreement with the  theoretical prediction, we found that sexual selection increased risks of local  extinction (dichromatic birds had on average a 23% higher local extinction rate  than monochromatic species). However, despite higher local extinction  probabilities, the number of dichromatic species did not decrease over the period  considered in this study. This pattern was caused by higher local turnover rates  of dichromatic species, resulting in relatively stable communities for both  groups of species. Our results suggest that these communities function as  metacommunities, with frequent local extinctions followed by colonization.  Anthropogenic factors impeding dispersal might therefore have a significant  impact on the global persistence of sexually selected species.

AB Two experiments were conducted with a Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR)  spectrometer. The purpose of the first experiment was to detect and identify  Bacillus subtilis subsp. niger (BG) bioaerosol spores and kaolin dust in an  open-air release for which the thermal contrast between the aerosol temperature  and background brightness temperature is small. The second experiment estimated  the concentration of a small amount of triethyl phosphate (TEP) vapor in a closed  chamber in which an external blackbody radiation source was used and where the  thermal contrast was large. The deduced BG (TEP) extinction spectrum  (identification) showed an excellent match to the library BG (TEP) extinction  spectrum. Analysis of the time sequence of the measurements coincided well with  the presence (detection) of the BG during the measurements, and the estimated  concentration of time-dependent TEP vapor was excellent. The data were analyzed  with hyperspectral detection, identification, and estimation algorithms. The  algorithms were based on radiative transfer theory and statistical  signal-processing methods. A subspace orthogonal projection operator was used to  statistically subtract the large thermal background contribution to the  measurements, and a robust maximum-likelihood solution was used to deduce the  target (aerosol or vapor cloud) spectrum and estimate its mass-column  concentration. A Gaussian-mixture probability model for the deduced mass-column  concentration was computed with an expectation-maximization algorithm to produce  the detection threshold, the probability of detection, and the probability of  false alarm. The results of this study are encouraging, as they suggest for the  first time to the authors' knowledge the feasibility of detecting biological  aerosols with passive FTIR sensors.

TI Life-history models of extinction: a test with island spiders.
SO The American naturalist
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB This study analyzes extinction patterns for two species of orb spiders monitored  annually on 77 islands over a continuous 20-yr period. One species, Argiope  argentata, has large populations sometimes crashing quickly to extinction and a  much weaker relation of extinction likelihood to population size than does the  other species, Metepeira datona. Demographic models were built for both species  and matched against observations. Differences between the species in life-history  traits-estimated with measurements from the field-together with incorporation of  demographic stochasticity, a population ceiling, and environmental stochasticity,  were necessary to fit the observed extinction curves. As predicted from  life-history patterns, long-term population growth rates (and hence predicted  extinction probabilities) are relatively very sensitive to values of juvenile  survivorship. Models are also sensitive to variation in the population ceiling  and environmental noise, which tend to act in a complementary manner. A simple  model with no age structure was able to fit the data on large initial population  sizes but not on small initial population sizes, showing that life cycle  characteristics interact with the various sources of stochasticity and hence have  to be taken into account to produce a precise model of the extinction process.

TI Variation and polymorphism in helminth parasites.
SO Parasitology
LA English
DT Review
AB There are strong biological, evolutionary and immunological arguments for  predicting extensive polymorphism among helminth parasites, but relatively little  data and few instances from which the selective forces acting on parasite  diversity can be discerned. The paucity of information on intraspecific variation  stands in contrast to the fine detail with which helminth species have been  delineated by morphological techniques, accentuating a trend towards considering  laboratory strains as representative of a relatively invariant organism. However,  in the fast-moving evolutionary race between host and parasite one would predict  a monomorphic species would be driven to extinction. We review the arena of  intraspecific variation for the major helminth parasites, ranging from biological  properties such as host or vector preference, to biochemical and immunological  characteristics, as well as molecular markers such as DNA sequence variants.  These data are summarized, before focusing in more detail on polymorphisms within  protein-coding genes of potential relevance to the host-parasite relationship,  such as vaccine candidates. In particular, we discuss the available data on a  number of major antigens from the filarial nematode Brugia malayi. Information is  currently too sparse to answer the question of whether there is antigenic  variation in filariasis, but the indications are that proteins from the  blood-borne microfilarial stage show significant intraspecific variability.  Future work will define whether polymorphisms in these antigens may be driven by  exposure to the host immune response or reflect some other facet of parasite  biology.

TI Impulsive control strategies in biological control of pesticide.
SO Theoretical population biology
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB By presenting and analyzing the pest-predator model under insecticides used  impulsively, two impulsive strategies in biological control are put forward. The  first strategy: the pulse period is fixed, but the proportional constant E(1)  changes, which represents the fraction of pests killed by applying insecticide.  For this scheme, two thresholds, E(1)(**) and E(1)(*) for E(1) are obtained. If  E(1)>or=E(1)(*), both the pest and predator (natural enemies) populations go to  extinction. If E(1)(**)<E(1)<E(1)(*), the pest population converges to the  semi-trivial periodic solution while the predator population tends to zero. If  E(1) is less than E(1)(**) but even if close to E(1)(**), there exists a unique  positive periodic solution via bifurcation, which implies both the pest and the  predator populations oscillate with a positive amplitude. In this case, pest  population is killed to the maximum extent while the natural enemies are  preserved to avoid extinction. The second strategy: the proportional constant  E(1) is fixed (E(1)<E(1)(*) firstly), but the pulse period changes. For this  scheme, one threshold tau(0) for the pulse period tau is obtained. We can reach  the same target as above by controlling the period impulsive effect tau<tau(0),  even if close to tau(0). Our theoretical results are confirmed by numerical  simulations.

TI Allee effects, extinctions, and chaotic transients in simple population models.
SO Theoretical population biology
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB Discrete time single species models with overcompensating density dependence and  an Allee effect due to predator satiation and mating limitation are investigated.  The models exhibit four behaviors: persistence for all initial population  densities, bistability in which a population persists for intermediate initial  densities and otherwise goes extinct, extinction for all initial densities, and  essential extinction in which "almost every" initial density leads to extinction.  For fast-growing populations, these models show populations can persist at high  levels of predation even though lower levels of predation lead to essential  extinction. Alternatively, increasing the predator's handling time, the  population's carrying capacity, or the likelihood of mating success may lead to  essential extinction. In each of these cases, the mechanism behind these  disappearances are chaotic dynamics driving populations below a critical  threshold determined by the Allee effect. These disappearances are proceeded by  chaotic transients that are proven to be approximately exponentially distributed  in length and highly sensitive to initial population densities.

TI Effect of habitat fragmentation on dispersal in the butterfly Proclossiana
SO Comptes rendus biologies
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB Comparison of dispersal rates of the bog fritillary butterfly between continuous  and fragmented landscapes indicates that between patch dispersal is significantly  lower in the fragmented landscape, while population densities are of the same  order of magnitude. Analyses of the dynamics of the suitable habitat for the  butterfly in the fragmented landscape reveal a severe, non linear increase in  spatial isolation of patches over a time period of 30 years (i.e. 30 butterfly  generations), but simulations of the butterfly metapopulation dynamics using a  structured population model show that the lower dispersal rates in the fragmented  landscape are far above the critical threshold leading to metapopulation  extinction. These results indicate that changes in individual behaviour leading  to the decrease of dispersal rates in the fragmented landscape were rapidly  selected for when patch spatial isolation increased. The evidence of such an  adaptive answer to habitat fragmentation suggests that dispersal mortality is a  key factor for metapopulation persistence in fragmented landscapes. We emphasise  that landscape spatial configuration and patch isolation have to be taken into  account in the debate about large-scale conservation strategies.

TI Dispersal rates affect species composition in metacommunities of Sarracenia
SO The American naturalist
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB Dispersal among local communities can have a variety of effects on species  composition and diversity at local and regional scales. Local conditions (e.g.,  resource and predator densities) can have independent effects, as well as  interact with dispersal, to alter these patterns. Based on metacommunity models,  we predicted that local diversity would show a unimodal relationship with  dispersal frequency. We manipulated dispersal frequencies, resource levels, and  the presence of predators (mosquito larvae) among communities found in the  water-filled leaves of the pitcher plant Sarracenia purpurea. Diversity and  abundance of species of the middle trophic level, protozoa and rotifers, were  measured. Increased dispersal frequencies significantly increased regional  species richness and protozoan abundance while decreasing the variance among  local communities. Dispersal frequency interacted with predation at the local  community scale to produce patterns of diversity consistent with the model. When  predators were absent, we found a unimodal relationship between dispersal  frequency and diversity, and when predators were present, there was a flat  relationship. Intermediate dispersal frequencies maintained some species in the  inquiline communities by offsetting extinction rates. Local community composition  and the degree of connectivity between communities are both important for  understanding species diversity patterns at local and regional scales.

TI Air method measurements of apple vessel length distributions with improved
SO Journal of experimental botany
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB Studies showing that rootstock dwarfing potential is related to plant hydraulic  conductance led to the hypothesis that xylem properties are also related. Vessel  length distribution and other properties of apple wood from a series of varieties  were measured using the 'air method' in order to test this hypothesis. Apparatus  was built to measure and monitor conductivity to air of fresh wood segments of  different lengths. Theory for determining vessel length distribution was improved  to give a single parameter uni-modal vessel length probability density function.  The function, derived by combining the exponential extinction (with extinction  coefficient k) of wood conductivity to air (C) as wood length (x) increases (i.e.  C=Co exp (-kx)) with the differential double difference formula, is Px=xxk2 exp  (-kx), where Px is the fraction of vessels of length x. The main parameter of the  distribution, k, was found to be the inverse of the mode of the distribution,  i.e. the most common vessel length, Lo. Lo for ten apple rootstock and scion  varieties varied from 5.6+/-0.1 cm (+/-SE) for MM.111 to 9.0+/-1.0 for Prunifolia  (P <0.05). Average maximum vessel length was approximately 50 cm, and differences  were not significant. Effective vessel radii ranged from 14 for Prunifolia to  24.3+/-0.7 micro m for M.26, with standard errors less than 12% of the mean.  Specific conductivity of a 15 cm wood segment ranged from 2x109-4) to  1.6+/-0.2x10(-2) dm3 s(-1) kPa(-1) m(-1) for maruba and M.26, respectively, with  standard errors up to 63% of the mean. Vessel density at the air entry point  ranged from 18+/-3 to 42+/-6 vessels mm-2 for M.26 and MM.106, respectively, with  standard errors as high as 89% of the mean. It was concluded that there is no  general relationship between the wood properties investigated and rootstock size  class, and that plasticity increases from vessel lengths to radii to specific  conductivity and vessel densities.

TI Development of an assay for ozone-specific antioxidant capacity.
SO Inhalation toxicology
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB A method of determining the ozone-specific antioxidant capacity (OZAC) of lavage  samples from the respiratory system was developed: Gaseous ozone (O(3)) was  produced in cuvettes by irradiation with an ultraviolet lamp; aliquots of sample  or of a saline control were then added and sufficient time was allowed for  ozonation to reach completion; and an aliquot of indigo trisulfonate (ITS) was  added to react with excess O(3). Because each molecule of O(3) rapidly bleaches  one molecule of the deeply colored ITS, an OZAC value in concentration units was  computed from the difference in light absorbance between the sample and the  saline control multiplied by the extinction coefficient of ITS. Experiments in  0-40 micro M antioxidant solutions indicated that the OZAC values of uric acid  and ascorbic acid were close to their actual concentrations and were independent  of O(3) concentration. On the other hand, the OZAC of reduced glutathione and  possibly human nasal lavage were nonlinearly related to antioxidant concentration  and were directly related to O(3) concentration.

TI Maintenance of aphid clonal lineages: images of immortality?
SO Infection, genetics and evolution : journal of molecular epidemiology and
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB Artificial cloning and ancient asexuals have impacted upon both scientific and  lay thinking in applied and theoretical fields as diverse as medicine and  evolution. Hence, this is an opportune time to promote debate and discussion on  what maintains a clonal lineage. The genetic fidelity of a clone has been  discussed in detail elsewhere [Genet. Res. 79 (2002) 1; Biol. J. Linnean Soc. 79  (2003) 3]. In this paper, we focus on the lineage integrity (=longevity), or  physiological lifespan of a clone with respect to senesce in relation to factors  controlling telomere functioning. Aspects of cell line research pertinent to  eukaryotic clonal lineages are discussed and, in particular, we try to  extrapolate aspects of this research and apply it to apomictic (=mitotic) aphid  lineages to suggest how they may be maintained. Analogies are made between single  cells and individual aphids that senescence through a generation, whilst the  respective lineages persist for finite periods, unless that is, compensatory  mechanisms have evolved allowing immortality in the one and ancient asexuality in  the other. Such comparison may allow fresh insights into the mechanisms of clonal  lineage maintenance and evolution. We hypothesise that: (1). the cause of  extinction in eukaryotic clonal lineages is due to deleterious effects on key  regions of the genome, the chromosomal telomere being one such site; (2).  recombination acts as a common mechanism to reset telomere functioning, perhaps  more fundamental than its utility to reduce genetic load and maintain  adaptability; and (3). ancient lineages persist through time as a function of  group-specific compensatory mechanisms that maintain telomere integrity.

TI The evolution of androgenesis.
SO The American naturalist
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB It is well known that some species produce offspring carrying only female  chromosomes by processes such as apomixis and parthenogenesis (generically termed  "gynogenesis"). There are also several cases of natural reproduction by  androgenesis in which diploid offspring carry nuclear chromosomes from only the  male parent. We used population genetics models to investigate the conditions for  invasion of rare androgenesis alleles and the consequences of their spread. Our  models predict that androgenesis alleles often spread to fixation. If fixation  causes the loss of females or female function in the population, population  extinction occurs. Therefore, androgenesis alleles represent a new class of  selfish genetic elements. Extinction is more likely in dioecious species than in  hermaphrodites. Within dioecious species, extinction is more likely when  androgenesis occurs via paternal apomixis (vs. fusion or doubling of haploid  nuclei) and when females are the heterogametic sex (vs. male heterogamety). The  apparent rarity of androgenesis compared to gynogenesis could be because  androgenesis is harder to detect and more often leads to population extinction.  Also, there could be greater evolutionary constraints on the origin of mutations  for androgenesis. We suggest characteristics of groups in which further cases of  androgenesis are more likely to be found.

TI Conservation effort and assessment of population size in fluctuating
SO Journal of theoretical biology
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB We consider optimal conservation strategies for endangered populations. We assume  that the survival of the population is affected by unpredictable environmental  fluctuation and can be improved by conservation effort. Furthermore, the exact  value of the initial population size is assumed to be unknown. The conservation  strategy involves two aspects: investment of assessment effort, to improve the  estimate of the initial population size and investment of conservation effort.  Both types of effort imply economic costs. The optimal management strategy is  assumed to minimize the weighted sum of extinction probability and the economic  cost of the conservation and the assessment effort. (1) We first analyse the  optimal conservation effort when the current population size is known accurately.  (2) Next, we consider the situation in which there is limited information (i.e. a  cue) on population size. (3) We subsequently discuss the cases where the cue  accuracy can be improved by assessment of the population. We study the optimal  level of the assessment effort and discuss its dependence on various parameters.

TI Large Cretaceous sphenodontian from Patagonia provides insight into lepidosaur
SO Nature
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB Sphenodontian reptiles successfully radiated during Triassic and Jurassic times,  but were driven almost to extinction during the Cretaceous period. The sparse  Early Cretaceous record of sphenodontians has been interpreted as reflecting the  decline of the group in favour of lizards, their suspected ecological successors.  However, recent discoveries in Late Cretaceous beds in Patagonia partially modify  this interpretation. Numerous skeletons of a new sphenodontian, Priosphenodon  avelasi gen. et sp. nov., were collected from a single locality in the  Cenomanian-Turonian Candeleros Formation, where it is more abundant than any  other tetrapod group recorded in the quarry (for example, Crocodyliformes,  Serpentes, Dinosauria and Mammalia). Adult specimens of Priosphenodon reached one  metre in length, larger than any previously known terrestrial sphenodontian. Here  we propose, using available evidence, that sphenodontians were not a minor  component of the Cretaceous terrestrial ecosystems of South America, and that  their ecological replacement by squamates was delayed until the early Tertiary.  The new discovery helps to bridge the considerable gap in the fossil record  (around 120 million years) that separates the Early Cretaceous sphenodontians  from their living relatives (Sphenodon).

TI Impacts and evolution: future prospects.
SO Astrobiology
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB The discipline of astrobiology includes the dynamics of biological evolution. One  of the major ways that the cosmos influences life is through the catastrophic  environmental disruptions caused when comets and asteroids collide with a planet.  We now recognize that such impacts have caused mass extinctions and played a  major role in determining the evolution of life on Earth. The time-averaged  impact flux as a function of projectile energy can be derived from lunar  cratering statistics as well as the current population of near Earth asteroids  (NEAs). Effects of impacts of various energies can be modeled, using data from  historic impacts [such as the Cretaceous-Tertiary (KT) impactor 65 million years  ago] and the observed 1994 bombardment of Jupiter by fragments of Comet  Shoemaker-Levy 9. It is of particular interest to find from such models that the  terrestrial environment is highly vulnerable to perturbation from impacts, so  that even such a small event as the KT impact (by a projectile 10-15 km in  diameter) can lead to a mass extinction. Similar considerations allow us to model  the effects of still smaller (and much more likely) impacts, down to the size of  the asteroid that exploded over Tunguska in 1908 (energy approximately 10  megatons). Combining the impact flux with estimates of environmental and  ecological effects reveals that the greatest contemporary hazard is associated  with impactors near 1 million megatons in energy (approximately 2 km in diameter  for an asteroid). The current impact hazard is significant relative to other  natural hazards, and arguments can be developed to illuminate a variety of public  policy issues. The first priority in any plan for defense against impactors is to  survey the population of Earth-crossing NEAs and project their orbits forward in  time. This is the purpose of the Spaceguard Survey, which has already found more  than half of the NEAs >1 km in diameter. If there is an NEA on a collision course  with Earth, it can be discovered and the impact predicted with decades or more of  warning. It is then possible to consider how to deflect or disrupt the NEA.  Unlike other natural hazards, the impact risk can be largely eliminated, given  sufficient advanced knowledge to take action against the threatening projectile.

TI Ecological risk assessment of pollutant chemicals: extinction risk based on
SO Chemosphere
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB The extinction probability is one of the most useful endpoints that are utilized  in conservation biology. A parallel approach is advocated for the ecological risk  assessment of chemical pollutants. The presented framework estimates extinction  probability induced by pollutant chemicals in order to evaluate ecological  hazards of pollution, and is applicable to any biological community (aquatic or  terrestrial). The analytical framework, which is based on stochastic population  dynamics theory, is briefly explained. The extinction risk estimation is feasible  if ecotoxicological data concerning pollutant effects on population growth rate  of organisms (the intrinsic rate of natural increase), and if environmental  exposure concentration is provided. Tentative risk estimation was made for some  agrochemicals and surfactants on zooplankton populations (Daphnia) as target  organisms.

TI Sexual isolation and speciation in bacteria.
SO Genetica
LA English
DT Review
AB Like organisms from all other walks of life, bacteria are capable of sexual  recombination. However, unlike most plants and animals, bacteria recombine only  rarely, and when they do they are extremely promiscuous in their choice of sexual  partners. There may be no absolute constraints on the evolutionary distances that  can be traversed through recombination in the bacterial world, but interspecies  recombination is reduced by a variety of factors, including ecological isolation,  behavioral isolation, obstacles to DNA entry, restriction endonuclease activity,  resistance to integration of divergent DNA sequences, reversal of recombination  by mismatch repair, and functional incompatibility of recombined segments.  Typically, individual bacterial species are genetically variable for most of  these factors. Therefore, natural selection can modulate levels of sexual  isolation, to increase the transfer of genes useful to the recipient while  minimizing the transfer of harmful genes. Interspecies recombination is optimized  when recombination involves short segments that are just long enough to transfer  an adaptation, without co-transferring potentially harmful DNA flanking the  adaptation. Natural selection has apparently acted to reduce sexual isolation  between bacterial species. Evolution of sexual isolation is not a milestone  toward speciation in bacteria, since bacterial recombination is too rare to  oppose adaptive divergence between incipient species. Ironically, recombination  between incipient bacterial species may actually foster the speciation process,  by prohibiting one incipient species from out-competing the other to extinction.  Interspecific recombination may also foster speciation by introducing novel gene  loci from divergent species, allowing invasion of new niches.

TI The adaptive dynamics of altruism in spatially heterogeneous populations.
SO Evolution; international journal of organic evolution
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB We study the spatial adaptive dynamics of a continuous trait that measures  individual investment in altruism. Our study is based on an ecological model of a  spatially heterogeneous population from which we derive an appropriate measure of  fitness. The analysis of this fitness measure uncovers three different selective  processes controlling the evolution of altruism: the direct physiological cost,  the indirect genetic benefits of cooperative interactions, and the indirect  genetic costs of competition for space. In our model, habitat structure and a  continuous life cycle makes the cost of competing for space with relatives  negligible. Our study yields a classification of adaptive patterns of altruism  according to the shape of the costs of altruism (with decelerating, linear, or  accelerating dependence on the investment in altruism). The invasion of altruism  occurs readily in species with accelerating costs, but large mutations are  critical for altruism to evolve in selfish species with decelerating costs.  Strict selfishness is maintained by natural selection only under very restricted  conditions. In species with rapidly accelerating costs, adaptation leads to an  evolutionarily stable rate of investment in altruism that decreases smoothly with  the level of mobility. A rather different adaptive pattern emerges in species  with slowly accelerating costs: high altruism evolves at low mobility, whereas a  quasi-selfish state is promoted in more mobile species. The high adaptive level  of altruism can be predicted solely from habitat connectedness and physiological  parameters that characterize the pattern of cost. We also show that environmental  changes that cause increased mobility in those highly altruistic species can  beget selection-driven self-extinction, which may contribute to the rarity of  social species.

TI Rapid body size decline in Alaskan Pleistocene horses before extinction.
SO Nature
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB About 70% of North American large mammal species were lost at the end of the  Pleistocene epoch. The causes of this extinction--the role of humans versus that  of climate--have been the focus of much controversy. Horses have figured  centrally in that debate, because equid species dominated North American late  Pleistocene faunas in terms of abundance, geographical distribution, and species  variety, yet none survived into the Holocene epoch. The timing of these equid  regional extinctions and accompanying evolutionary changes are poorly known. In  an attempt to document better the decline and demise of two Alaskan Pleistocene  equids, I selected a large number of fossils from the latest Pleistocene for  radiocarbon dating. Here I show that horses underwent a rapid decline in body  size before extinction, and I propose that the size decline and subsequent  regional extinction at 12,500 radiocarbon years before present are best  attributed to a coincident climatic/vegetational shift. The present data do not  support human overkill and several other proposed extinction causes, and also  show that large mammal species responded somewhat individualistically to climate  changes at the end of the Pleistocene.

SO Journal of evolutionary biology

DT Journal Article
AB In this paper, we predict the outcome of dispersal evolution in metapopulations  based on the following assumptions: (i) population dynamics within patches are  density-regulated by realistic growth functions; (ii) demographic stochasticity  resulting from finite population sizes within patches is accounted for; and (iii)  the transition of individuals between patches is explicitly modelled by a  disperser pool. We show, first, that evolutionarily stable dispersal rates do not  necessarily increase with rates for the local extinction of populations due to  external disturbances in habitable patches. Second, we describe how demographic  stochasticity affects the evolution of dispersal rates: evolutionarily stable  dispersal rates remain high even when disturbance-related rates of local  extinction are low, and a variety of qualitatively different responses of adapted  dispersal rates to varied levels of disturbance become possible. This paper  shows, for the first time, that evolution of dispersal rates may give rise to  monotonically increasing or decreasing responses, as well as to intermediate  maxima or minima.

TI Remarks on branching-extinction evolutionary cycles.
SO Journal of mathematical biology
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB We show in this paper that the evolution of cannibalistic consumer populations  can be a never ending story involving alternating levels of polymorphism. More  precisely, we show that a monomorphic population can evolve toward high levels of  cannibalism until it reaches a so-called branching point, where the population  splits into two sub-populations characterized by different, but initially very  close, cannibalistic traits. Then, the two traits coevolve until the more  cannibalistic sub-population undergoes evolutionary extinction. Finally, the  remaining population evolves back to the branching point, thus closing an  evolutionary cycle. The model on which the study is based is purely deterministic  and derived through the adaptive dynamics approach. Evolutionary dynamics are  investigated through numerical bifurcation analysis, applied both to the  ecological (resident-mutant) model and to the evolutionary model. The general  conclusion emerging from this study is that branching-extinction evolutionary  cycles can be present in wide ranges of environmental and demographic parameters,  so that their detection is of crucial importance when studying evolutionary  dynamics.

TI Impacts of environmental variability in open populations and communities:
SO Theoretical population biology
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB Ecological communities are typically open to the immigration and emigration of  individuals, and also variable through time. In this paper we argue that  interesting and potentially important effects arise when one splices together  spatial fluxes and temporal variability. The particular system we examine is a  sink habitat, where a species faces deterministic extinction but is rescued by  recurrent immigration. We have shown, using a simple extension of the canonical  exponential growth model in a time-varying environment, that variation "inflates"  the average abundance of sink populations. We can analytically quantify the  magnitude of this effect in several special cases (square-wave temporal variation  and Gaussian stochastic variation). The inflationary effect can be large in  "intermittent" sinks (where there are periods with positive growth), and when  temporal variation is strongly autocorrelated. The effect appears to be robust to  incorporation of demographic stochasticity (due to discrete  birth-death-immigration processes), and to direct density dependence. With  discrete generations, however, one can observe a wide range of effects of  temporal variation, including depression as well as inflation. We argue that the  inflationary effect of temporal variation in sink habitats can have important  implications for community structure, because it can increase the average  abundance (and hence local impacts) of species that on average are being excluded  from a local community. We illustrate the latter effect using a familiar model of  exploitative competition for a single limiting resource. We demonstrate that  temporal variation can reverse local competitive dominance, even to the extent of  allowing an inferior competitor maintained by immigration to exclude a competing  species that would be locally superior in a constant environment.

DT Journal Article
AB Silene vulgaris was introduced into North America sometime prior to 1800. In  order to document the population structure that has developed since that time,  collections were made from 56 local populations distributed among 9 geographical  regions in eastern North America. Individual plants were characterized for  chloroplast DNA (cpDNA) haplotype by restriction fragment size analysis of four  noncoding regions of cpDNA amplified by polymerase chain reaction. A total of 19  cpDNA haplotypes were detected using this method. The overall gene diversity of  0.85 is quite similar to the diversity detected in these same regions of cpDNA in  a previously published sample of S. vulgaris taken from across much of Europe.  The spatial distribution of the North American cpDNA diversity was quantified by  hierarchical F-statistics that partitioned the genetic variance into variation  among local populations within regions, and variation among regions. The average  FST among populations within regions was 0.66 and the FST among regions was 0.09.  The among-region variation was due to both differences among regions in the  frequency of two most common haplotypes, and to the presence of a number of  region-specific haplotypes. In order to test for isolation by distance at the  regional level, FST values were calculated for all possible pairs of regions, and  regressed against the geographical distance between those regions. There was no  evidence for isolation by distance. It is suggested that the local population  structure is generated by recent extinction/colonization dynamics, and that the  among-region structure reflects demographic events associated with range  expansion following introduction to North America.

TI State-dependent modulation of feeding behavior by proopiomelanocortin-derived
SO Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB Feeding behavior can be divided into appetitive and consummatory phases,  differing in neural substrates and effects of deprivation. Opioids play an  important role in the appetitive aspects of feeding, but they also have acute  stimulatory effects on food consumption. Because the opioid peptide  beta-endorphin is co-synthesized and released with melanocortins from  proopiomelanocortin (POMC) neuronal terminals, we examined the physiological role  of beta-endorphin in feeding and energy homeostasis using a strain of mutant mice  with a selective deficiency of beta-endorphin. Male beta-endorphin-deficient mice  unexpectedly became obese with ad libitum access to rodent chow. Total body  weight increased by 15% with a 50-100% increase in the mass of white fat. The  mice were hyperphagic with a normal metabolic rate. Despite the absence of  endogenous beta-endorphin, the mutant mice did not differ from wild-type mice in  their acute feeding responses to beta-endorphin or neuropeptide Y administered  intracerebroventricularly or naloxone administered intraperitoneally. Additional  mice were studied using an operant behavioral paradigm to examine their  acquisition of food reinforcers under increasing work demands. Food-deprived,  beta-endorphin-deficient male mice emitted the same number of lever presses under  a progressive ratio schedule compared to wild-type mice. However, the mutant mice  worked significantly less than did the wild-type mice for food reinforcers under  nondeprived conditions. Controls for nonspecific effects on acquisition of  conditioned learning, activity, satiety, and resistance to extinction revealed no  genotype differences, supporting our interpretation that beta-endorphin  selectively affects a motivational component of reward behavior under nondeprived  conditions. Therefore, we propose that beta-endorphin may function in at least  two primary modes to modulate feeding. In the appetitive phase, beta-endorphin  release increases the incentive value of food as a primary reinforcer. In  contrast, it appears that endogenous beta-endorphin may inhibit food consumption  in parallel with melanocortins and that the orexigenic properties previously  ascribed to it may actually be due to other classes of endogenous opioid  peptides.

SO Journal of mathematical biology
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB In Part I of this paper Jacobs and Metz (2003) extended the concept of the  Conley-Ruelle, or chain, attractor in a way relevant to unstructured community  ecological models. Their modified theory incorporated the facts that certain  parts of the boundary of the state space correspond to the situation of at least  one species being extinct and that an extinct species can not be rescued by  noise. In this part we extend the theory to communities of physiologically  structured populations. One difference between the structured and unstructured  cases is that a structured population may be doomed to extinction and not  rescuable by any biologically relevant noise before actual extinction has taken  place. Another difference is that in the structured case we have to use different  topologies to define continuity of orbits and to measure noise. Biologically  meaningful noise is furthermore related to the linear structure of the community  state space. The construction of extinction preserving chain attractors developed  in this paper takes all these points into account.

AB Ancient asexual animal groups, such as bdelloid rotifers and darwinuloid  ostracods, are excellent model organisms to study the effects of long-term  asexuality. However, the absolute length of time that these groups have been  fully asexual is mostly ignored. In the case of the darwinuloid ostracods, the  fossil record shows that sexual reproduction disappeared almost completely after  the end of Permian mass extinction (ca. 245 Myr ago), although several putative  records of males from the Mesozoic obscure the exact time-frame of obligate  asexuality in darwinuloids. Here, we re-examine the Mesozoic darwinuloid records,  with regard to the reproductive mode of the assemblages. Three criteria to  distinguish males in fossil populations (lack of brood pouch, position of muscle  scars and size dimorphism) are used here to test for the presence of males in  darwinuloid assemblages. A large, well-preserved assemblage of Darwinula  leguminella (Forbes 1885) from the latest Jurassic (ca. 145 Myr ago) of England  is found to be markedly variable in size and shape, but nevertheless turns out to  be an all female assemblage. The exceptional preservation of the material also  allows the re-assignment of this species to the extant darwinuloid genus  Alicenula. All other putative dimorphic darwinuloid records from the Mesozoic are  re-examined using the same criteria. The hypothesis that these assemblages  represent bisexual populations is rejected for all post-Triassic (ca. 208 Myr  ago) records.

DT Journal Article
AB The most common effect of the endosymbiont Wolbachia is cytoplasmic  incompatibility (CI), a form of postzygotic reproductive isolation that occurs in  crosses where the male is infected by at least one Wolbachia strain that the  female lacks. We revisited two puzzling features of Wolbachia biology: how  Wolbachia can invade a new species and spread among populations, and how the  association, once established in a host species, can evolve, with emphasis on the  possible process of infection loss. These questions are particularly relevant in  haplodiploid species, where males develop from unfertilized eggs, and females  from fertilized eggs. When CI occurs in such species, fertilized eggs either die  (female mortality type: FM), or develop into males (male development type: MD),  raising one more question: how transition among CI types is possible. We reached  the following conclusions: (1) the FM type is a better invader and should be  retained preferentially after a new host is captured; (2) given the assumptions  of the models, FM and MD types are selected on neither the bacterial side nor the  host side; (3) selective pressures acting on both partners are more or less  congruent in the FM type, but divergent in the MD type; (4) host and symbiont  evolution can drive infection to extinction for all CI types, but the MD type is  more susceptible to the phenomenon; and (5) under realistic conditions,  transition from MD to FM type is possible. Finally, all these results suggest  that the FM type should be more frequent than the MD type, which is consistent  with the results obtained so far in haplodiploids.

AB A novel vehicle emissions remote sensing system (VERSS) for the on-road  measurement of fuel-based particulate matter (PM) emission factors is described.  This system utilizes two complementary PM channels using an ultraviolet Lidar and  transmissometer for the measurement of PM mass column content behind a passing  vehicle. Ratioing the PM mass column content with the carbon mass column content,  simultaneously measured with infrared absorption, yields the fuel-based PM mass  emission factor. The transmissometer directly yields PM extinction coefficients  without calibration, while the Lidar measurement of PM backscatter coefficients  is calibrated through laboratory measurements of gases with well-known  backscatter coefficients. The PM mass column content is calculated from these  extinction and backscatter coefficients with the help of mass backscatter and  extinction efficiencies obtained from theoretical calculations. This novel VERSS  has been used extensively in a major air quality study, and example data are  presented.

TI Nonstochastic variation of species-level diversification rates within
SO Evolution; international journal of organic evolution
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB Variations in the origination and extinction rates of species over geological  time often are linked with a range of factors, including the evolution of key  innovations, changes in ecosystem structure, and environmental factors such as  shifts in climate and physical geography. Before hypothesizing causality of a  single factor, it is critical to demonstrate that the observed variation in  diversification is significantly greater than one would expect due to natural  stochasticity in the evolutionary branching process. Here, we use a  likelihood-ratio test to compare taxonomic rate heterogeneity to a neutral  birth-death model, using data on well-supported sister pairs of taxa and their  species richness. We test the likelihood that the distribution of extant species  among angiosperm genera and families could be the result of constant  diversification rates. Results strongly support the conclusion that there is  significantly more heterogeneity in diversity at the species level within  angiosperms than would be expected due to stochastic processes. This result is  consistent in datasets of genus pairs and family pairs and is not affected  significantly by degrading pairs to simulate inaccuracy in the assumption of  simultaneous origin of sister taxa. When we parse taxon pairs among higher groups  of angiosperms, results indicate that a constant rates model is not rejected by  rosid and basal eudicot pairs but is rejected by asterid and eumagnoliid pairs.  These results provide strong support for the hypothesis that species-level rates  of origination and/or extinction have varied nonrandomly within angiosperms and  that the magnitude of heterogeneity varies among major groups within angiosperms.

AB Enhanced expression of (pro)matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) is associated with  human tumor invasion and/or metastasis. COH cells derived from a highly invasive  and metastatic Ewing's sarcoma constitutively express proMMP-9. Transfection of a  double stranded RNA that targets the MMP-9 mRNA into COH cells depleted the  corresponding mRNA and protein as demonstrated by reverse transcriptase-PCR,  enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and gelatin zymography. proMMP-9 extinction  resulted in the following: (i) decreased spreading on extracellular matrix  (fibronectin, laminin, collagen IV)-coated surfaces, (ii) inhibition of migration  toward fibronectin, and (iii) induced aggregation, which was specifically  disrupted by a function-blocking E-cadherin antibody. MMP-9 knockdown  concomitantly resulted in increased levels of surface E-cadherin, redistribution  at the plasma membrane of beta-catenin, and its physical association with  E-cadherin. Moreover, induction of E-cadherin-mediated adhesion was associated  with RhoA activation and changes in paxillin cytoskeleton. Finally, an inhibitor  of gelatinolytic activity of pro-MMP9 did not reduce COH cell migration  confirming that the enzymatic property of COH MMP-9 was not required for  migration toward fibronectin. Overall, our observations define a novel critical  role for proMMP-9 in providing a cellular switch between stationary and migratory  cell phases.

TI The use of mathematical models to simulate control options for echinococcosis.
SO Acta tropica
LA English
DT Review
AB In many parts of the world Echinococcus granulosus is a widespread infection in  sheep and dogs with a consequential spill over into the human population. In the  past, mathematical models have been derived to define the transmission dynamics  of this parasite, principally in the sheep-dog life cycle. These models have  characterized the cycles of infection as lacking in density dependent constraints  in both the definitive or intermediate hosts. This suggested that there was  little, if any, induced host immunity by the parasite in either host in natural  infections. However, recent evidence from both Tunisia and Kazakhstan, where  young dogs are the most heavily parasitised, suggests the possibility of  significant definitive host immunity. This may have an effect on the control  effort needed to destabilize the parasite. A preliminary computer simulation  model (based on an Excel spreadsheet) to attempt to predict the results of a  control programme has been written. This demonstrates that there could be  significantly different results if there is indeed protective immunity in the dog  than in the absence of immunity. In the former the parasite needs a greater  control effort to push the parasite towards extinction than in the latter. The  computer simulation is based on a mathematical model of the parasite's life cycle  and is flexible so that different values of parameters can be used in different  situations where the transmission of the parasite may be at different levels.  Because of the flexibility of the computer simulation it is anticipated that this  programme can be applied in most situations, although initial parameters for a  particular location or strain of the parasite will have to be first predetermined  with base line field surveys and possibly experimental infections. The programme  also has an additional flexibility to enable simulations if some parameters  cannot be accurately estimated through Monte-Carlo techniques. In the latter  situation, worst and best case scenarios can be estimated and likely frequency  distributions of the unknown parameters can be included in the model.

TI Determinism in a transient assemblage: the roles of dispersal and local
SO The American naturalist
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB Both dispersal and local competitive ability may determine the outcome of  competition among species that cannot coexist locally. I develop a spatially  implicit model of two-species competition at a small spatial scale. The model  predicts the relative fitness of two competitors based on local reproductive  rates and regional dispersal rates in the context of the number, size, and  extinction probability of habitat patches in the landscape. I test the  predictions of this model experimentally using two genotypes of the  bacteriophagous soil nematode Caenorhabditis elegans in patchy microcosms. One  genotype has higher fecundity while the other is a better disperser. With such a  fecundity-dispersal trade-off between competitors, the model predicts that  relative fitness will be affected most by local population size when patches do  not go extinct and by the number of patches when there is a high probability of  patch extinction. The microcosm experiments support the model predictions. Both  approaches suggest that competitive dominance in a patchily distributed transient  assemblage will depend upon the architecture and predictability of the  environment. These mechanisms, operating at a small scale with high spatial  admixture, may be embedded in a larger metacommunity process.

TI PM2.5 mass and light extinction reconstruction in IMPROVE.

LA English
DT Journal Article
AB Compliance under the Regional Haze Rule of 1999 is based on Interagency  Monitoring of Protected Visual Environments (IMPROVE) protocols for  reconstructing aerosol mass and light extinction from aerosol chemical  concentrations measured in the IMPROVE network. The accuracy, consistency, and  potential biases in these formulations were examined using IMPROVE aerosol  chemistry and light extinction data from 1988-1999. Underestimation of  particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter < 2.5 microm (PM2.5) by the  IMPROVE mass reconstruction formula by 12%, on average, appears to be related to  the exclusion of sodium, chlorine, and other elements and to artifacts associated  with the measurement of organic carbon, but not to absorption of water by  sulfates and nitrates on IMPROVE Teflon filters during weighing. Light scattering  measured by transmissometry is not consistent with nephelometer scattering or  single-scatter albedos expected for remote locations. Light scattering was  systematically overestimated by 34%, on average, with the IMPROVE particle  scattering (Bsp) reconstruction formula. The use of climatologically based  hygroscopic growth factors f(RH) suggested for compliance with the Haze Rule  contributes significantly to this overestimation and increases the amount of  light extinction attributable to sulfates for IMPROVE samples between 1993 and  1999 by 5 percentage points.

TI The importance of hippocampus-dependent non-spatial tasks in analyses of homology
SO Brain, behavior and evolution
LA English
DT Review
AB The hippocampus or a homologous region plays a role in spatial tasks in a large  number of vertebrate species. This result, in combination with recent findings of  adaptive specializations of the hippocampus for spatial demands, has led to the  conclusion that the prominent selective force behind hippocampal evolution was a  need for spatial abilities. However, a review of non-spatial  hippocampus-dependent tasks shows that many vertebrate species also share  non-spatial functions of the hippocampus. Placed in the appropriate phylogenetic  context, it becomes clear that non-spatial facets of hippocampal function were  just as likely to be present in our vertebrate ancestors as spatial ones. In  addition, the absence of spatial strategy use in three lineages suggests  divergence of this feature. Divergence in this character and other  characteristics of hippocampal function are meaningful indicators of lineage  specific functions. Studies of the evolution of the hippocampus must include  examination of spatial and non-spatial functions of the hippocampus and consider  both conserved, as well as derived, features.

TI Earliest evidence of cynodont burrowing.
SO Proceedings. Biological sciences
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB A 251 million year old partial burrow cast containing an articulated skeleton of  the mammal-like carnivore Thrinaxodon liorhinus is the oldest evidence for  burrowing by a cynodont synapsid. The burrow cast comes from terrestrial flood  plain sediments close to the Permian-Triassic boundary in the Karoo of South  Africa. Together with those of the later cynodont Trirachodon, the Thrinaxodon  burrow cast indicates that burrow-making was broadly distributed in basal  synapsids and has a long history in non-mammalian synapsid evolution. A  reconstruction of its appendicular skeleton in cross-section indicates that  Thrinaxodon was able to adopt a facultatively mammalian stance within its burrow  shaft. Burrows of cynodont design are more common in Triassic rocks than  previously realized, and suggest that burrowing may represent an adaptive  response by cynodonts to the environmental conditions associated with the mass  extinction event that punctuated the end of the preceding Permian period. The  widespread occurrence of burrowing among extant mammals implies that the ancient  synapsid ability to burrow conferred a strong adaptive value in the evolution of  Mammalia.

TI Antibodies reactive to heat shock protein 90 induce oligodendrocyte precursor
SO FASEB journal : official publication of the Federation of American Societies for
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB Oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) are extremely efficient at remyelination.  These cells persist in the adult human central nervous system and can  proliferate. However, the failure to remyelinate is a pathological characteristic  of the human demyelinating disease multiple sclerosis (MS), which suggests that  these cells are ineffective in this disorder. This paper reports that IgG  antibodies in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of MS patients specifically recognize  an antigen on OPCs in culture. Control patients were found not to possess these  antibodies. The antigen was immunoprecipitated in cell extracts from cultures  with purified IgG from MS CSF. Peptide mass fingerprinting identified it as the  beta type of heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90). Two-dimensional electrophoresis and  immunoblot showed that this antigen in fact corresponds to two specific isoforms  of Hsp90beta. Several control assays using monoclonal and polyclonal anti-Hsp90  antibodies confirmed the specific expression of Hsp90 on OPCs. Labeling OPCs in  vivo with MS CSF and anti-Hsp90 antibodies and subsequent immunofluorescence  confocal microscopy located the antigen on the cell surface. The binding of CSF  antibodies from MS patients to the OPC surface led to complement activation and  significant extinction of the OPC population. These results suggest that OPCs may  be a target of anti-Hsp90 antibodies in MS patients and that this could prevent  remyelination.

DT Journal Article
AB Fourier Transform Ion Cyclotron Resonance Mass Spectrometry (ESI-FTICR-MS)  coupled with infrared multiphoton dissociation (IRMPD) is potentially a powerful  method for rapid phosphopeptide mapping of complex proteolytic digests. The  dissociation of deprotonated phosphopeptides by IRMPD is energetically favorable  over unmodified deprotonated peptides because of a lower energy of activation and  a higher internal energy under identical irradiation conditions. The energies of  activation for dissociation are determined for model peptides phosphorylated on  an aliphatic side chain (serine) and an aromatic side chain (tyrosine). The  determination of phosphorylation location provides important biochemical  information identifying the kinase involved in specific phosphorylation  mechanisms. The data presented in this manuscript also support the theory that  for phosphopeptides, the phosphate moiety's P-O stretch is in direct resonance  with the infrared laser (10.6 microm), thus increasing the relative absorptivity  of the modified species. A greater extinction coefficient affords more extensive  photon absorption and subsequently a greater internal energy at the rapid  exchange limit.

AB Ginseng, the underground parts of plants of Panax species, has been used in  oriental traditional medicine for centuries. Unfortunately, because of extensive  exploitation over thousands of years, the natural source of these species has  been almost exhausted. Recently, we have found a wild ginseng growing in Myanmar.  Here, by a combination of chemical composition study and gene sequence analysis,  we unambiguously demonstrate that the wild ginseng is actually P. zingiberensis,  commonly known as ginger ginseng. This ginseng was an indigenous to the  southwestern China. However, now it is seriously threatened to brink of  extinction and is put on the highest level of protection in China. Therefore, an  appropriate protection measure is highly recommended to preserve this valuable  resource, since this Myanmar ginseng might turn out to be the last P.  zingiberensis, which could ever be seen in the planet.

TI Current knowledge of gene flow in plants: implications for transgene flow.
SO Philosophical transactions of the Royal Society of London. Series B, Biological
LA English
DT Review
AB Plant evolutionary biologists' view of gene flow and hybridization has undergone  a revolution. Twenty-five years ago, both were considered rare and largely  inconsequential. Now gene flow and hybridization are known to be idiosyncratic,  varying with the specific populations involved. Gene flow typically occurs at  evolutionarily significant rates and at significant distances. Spontaneous  hybridization occasionally has important applied consequences, such as  stimulating the evolution of more aggressive invasives and increasing the  extinction risk for rare species. The same problems have occurred for spontaneous  hybridization between crops and their wild relatives. These new data have  implications for transgenic crops: (i) for most crops, gene flow can act to  introduce engineered genes into wild populations; (ii) depending on the specific  engineered gene(s) and populations involved, gene flow may have the same negative  impacts as those observed for traditionally improved crops; (iii) gene flow's  idiosyncratic nature may frustrate management and monitoring attempts; and (iv)  intercrop transgene flow, although rarely discussed, is equally worthy of study.

TI Extinction-colonization dynamics structure genetic variation of spotted sunfish
SO Molecular ecology
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB The population genetics of aquatic animals in the Florida Everglades may be  strongly influenced by extinction and colonization dynamics. We combined analyses  of allozyme and microsatellite loci to test the hypothesis that two levels of  population structure are present for spotted sunfish (Pisces: Centrarchidae:  Lepomis punctatus) inhabiting the Everglades. We hypothesized that annual cycles  of marsh dry-down increase local-scale genetic variation through a process of  local extinction and colonization; we hypothesized that barriers to gene flow by  levee/canal systems create a second, regional level of genetic variation. In 1996  and 1997, we sampled spotted sunfish from 11 Everglades sites that were  distributed in three regions separated by levees. We documented patterns of  genetic variation at 7 polymorphic allozyme loci and 5 polymorphic microsatellite  loci. Most genetic variation was present among local populations, according to  both types of genetic markers. Furthermore, samples from marsh sites were  heterogeneous, while those from canals were not. These data supported our  hypothesis that dry-down events and local population dynamics in the marsh have a  significant effect on population genetic structure of spotted sunfish. We found  no support for our hypothesis that water-management structures superimpose a  second level of genetic structure on this species, possibly because canals  obscure historical structure by facilitating gene flow or because the complete  canal system has been in place for fewer than 20 generations of this species. Our  data suggests a continent-island (canal-marsh) structure of populations with high  gene flow among regions and recurrent mixing in marshes from canal and creek  habitats.

AB We propose a minimal model of the dynamics of diversity-replicator equations with  extinction, invasion and mutation. We numerically study the behavior of this  simple model and show that it displays completely different behavior from the  conventional replicator equation and the generalized Lotka-Volterra equation. We  reach several significant conclusions as follows: (1) a complex ecosystem can  emerge when mutants with respect to species-specific interaction are introduced;  (2) such an ecosystem possesses strong resistance to invasion; (3) a typical  fixation process of mutants is realized through the rapid growth of a group of  mutualistic mutants with higher fitness than majority species; (4) a hierarchical  taxonomic structure (like family-genus-species) emerges; and (5) the relative  abundance of species exhibits a typical pattern widely observed in nature.  Several implications of these results are discussed in connection with the  relationship of the present model to the generalized Lotka-Volterra equation.

AB Cooperative biological systems are susceptible to disruption by cheating. Using  the social bacterium Myxococcus xanthus, we have tested the short-term  competitive fates of mixed cheater and wild-type strains over multiple cycles of  cooperative development. Cheater/wild-type mixes underwent several cycles of  starvation-induced multicellular development followed by spore germination and  vegetative population growth. The population sizes of cheater and wild-type  strains in each pairwise mixture were measured at the end of each developmental  phase and each growth phase. Cheater genotypes showed several distinct  competitive fates, including cheater persistence at high frequencies with little  effect on total population dynamics, cheater persistence after major disruption  of total population dynamics, self-extinction of cheaters with wild-type  survival, and total population extinction. Our results empirically demonstrate  that social exploitation can destabilize a cooperative biological system and  increase the risk of local extinction events.

AB The estimation of diversification rates using phylogenetic data has attracted a  lot of attention in the past decade. In this context, the analysis of incomplete  phylogenies (e.g. phylogenies resolved at the family level but unresolved at the  species level) has remained difficult. I present here a likelihood-based method  to combine partly resolved phylogenies with taxonomic (species-richness) data to  estimate speciation and extinction rates. This method is based on fitting a  birth-and-death model to both phylogenetic and taxonomic data. Some examples of  the method are presented with data on birds and on mammals. The method is  compared with existing approaches that deal with incomplete phylogenies. Some  applications and generalizations of the approach introduced in this paper are  further discussed.

TI New inferences from tree shape: numbers of missing taxa and population growth
SO Systematic biology
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB The relative positions of branching events in a phylogeny contain information  about evolutionary and population dynamic processes. We provide new summary  statistics of branching event times and describe how these statistics can be used  to infer rates of species diversification from interspecies trees or rates of  population growth from intraspecies trees. We also introduce a phylogenetic  method for estimating the level of taxon sampling in a clade. Different  evolutionary models and different sampling regimes can produce similar patterns  of branching events, so it is important to consider explicitly the model  assumptions involved when making evolutionary inferences. Results of an analysis  of the phylogeny of the mosquito-borne flaviviruses suggest that there could be  several thousand currently unidentified viruses in this clade.

TI The paradox of the parasites: implications for biological invasion.
SO Proceedings. Biological sciences
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB The enemy-release hypothesis for biological invasions supposes that invasive  species may be more successful in their introduced ranges than in their native  ranges owing to the absence of coevolved natural enemies. Recent studies  supporting this hypothesis have found that introduced plants and animals are less  parasitized in their introduced ranges than in their native ranges. Expanding on  this theory, I hypothesize that the role of enemy release may differ among the  introduction, establishment and spread phases of an invasion. I present a simple  model indicating that parasite release is unlikely to greatly affect the chance  of establishment in populations with and without an immune subpopulation. The  specific numerical relationship between the number of individuals introduced and  the chance of establishment depends on a relationship between virulence, here  conceptualized as the chance for the extinction of a lineage, and the fraction of  the population infected at introduction. These results support the idea of a  'filter effect' in which different biological processes regulate the different  phases of an invasion.

TI The last dicynodont: an Australian Cretaceous relict.
SO Proceedings. Biological sciences
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB Some long-forgotten fossil evidence reveals that a dicynodont (mammal-like  reptile of the infraorder Dicynodontia) inhabited Australia as recently as the  Early Cretaceous, ca. 110 Myr after the supposed extinction of dicynodonts in the  Late Triassic. This remarkably late occurrence more than doubles the known  duration of dicynodont history (from ca. 63 Myr to ca. 170 Myr) and betrays the  profound impact of geographical isolation on Australian terrestrial faunas  through the Mesozoic. Australia's late-surviving dicynodont may be envisaged as a  counterpart of the ceratopians (horned dinosaurs) in Cretaceous tetrapod faunas  of Asia and North America.

TI Probable extirpation of a breeding colony of Short-tailed Albatross (Phoebastria
SO Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB Albatrosses (Diomedeidae) do not occur in the North Atlantic Ocean today except  as vagrants, although five species were present in the early Pliocene. No fossil  breeding sites of albatrosses were known previously. The timing of extinction of  albatrosses in the North Atlantic was likewise unknown. Deposits that formed near  present-day sea level along the southeastern shore of Bermuda contain remains of  a former breeding colony and include intact eggshells and bones of embryos,  juveniles, and adults of Short-tailed Albatross (Phoebastria albatrus), a  critically endangered species now confined to a few islets in the northwestern  Pacific Ocean. These deposits are correlated with the middle Pleistocene Lower  Town Hill Formation, which at other sites have a radiometric age of 405,000 years  ago. This equates with the marine isotope stage 11 interglacial, which culminated  in a rise in sea-level to >+20 m. Bones of a juvenile Short-tailed Albatross were  also found in beach deposits at +21.3 m from this same interglacial. We interpret  the extirpation of albatrosses on Bermuda as probably resulting from lack of  nesting sites protected from storm surges over the little emergent land that  remained at the height of the marine isotope stage 11 sea level rise.

TI The influence of variable rates of inbreeding on fitness, environmental
SO Evolution; international journal of organic evolution
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB We manipulated experimental populations of the housefly (Musca domestica L.)  under three inbreeding schemes (fast, slow, and punctuated) to partition out the  influences of different means and variances in the rate of inbreeding, per  generation, while controlling for the final level of inbreeding as a constant.  One treatment used constant fast inbreeding (11% per generation; Ne = 4 for 4  generations), for a comparison to one that was consistently slow (3% per  generation; Ne = 16 for 14 generations). The third followed a model for serial  founder-flush events. Each founder-flush episode involved a one-generation pulse  of fast inbreeding (Ne = 4) followed by two generations of very low (or no)  inbreeding, yielding high intergenerational variation (i.e., for an average  inbreeding rate of 4% per generation). Allozyme assays showed that we achieved  the intended final inbreeding coefficient of about 37%. All inbreeding schemes  decreased fitness levels in terms of egg-to-adult viability, development time,  and male mating success relative to the outbred control. The consistently fast  inbreeding protocol had more pronounced reductions in fitness, relative to the  other two inbreeding schemes. In comparison to the fast and punctuated regimes,  the consistently slow protocol preserved evolutionary potential (as assayed by  the genetic divergence of subpopulations exposed to different environments) in  egg-to-adult viability, and (albeit anecdotally) reduced the extinction  probabilities, especially in a novel environment. The punctuated treatment did  not optimize the potential for purge as predicted, but instead reduced fitness,  evolutionary potential, and environmental responsiveness (as measured by  genotype-by-environment interactions). This founder-flush treatment also had the  highest extinction probabilities. Longer periods of population flush might be  necessary to purge effectively in a punctuated scheme. We conclude that the rate  of inbreeding, independent from the final level, can have important effects on  population fitness, environmental responsiveness, and evolutionary potential.

TI Isoform-specific knockout of FE65 leads to impaired learning and memory.
SO Journal of neuroscience research
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB FE65 is a multimodular adapter protein that is expressed predominantly in brain.  Its C-terminal phosphotyrosine interaction domain (PID) binds to the  intracellular tail of the beta-amyloid precursor protein (betaPP), a protein of  central importance to the pathogenesis of dementias of the Alzheimer type. To  study the physiological functions of FE65, we generated a line of FE65 knockout  mice via gene targeting. By Western analysis with a panel of FE65-specific  antibodies, we demonstrate that the 97-kDa full-length FE65 (p97) was ablated in  the mutant mice, and that a previously undescribed FE65 isoform with apparent  molecular mass of 60 kDa (p60) was expressed in both wild-type and mutant mice.  p60 had a truncated N-terminus and was likely to be generated through alternative  translation. Expressions of the two isoforms appeared to be brain region distinct  and age dependent. The p97FE65(-/-) mice were viable and showed no obvious  physical impairments or histopathological abnormalities. However, p97FE65(-/-)  and p97FE65(+/-) mice exhibited poorer performances than wild-type mice on a  passive avoidance task when tested at 14 months (P <.05). p97FE65(-/-) mice at 14  months also exhibited impaired hidden-platform acquisition (P <.05) and a severe  reversal-learning deficit (P <.002) but normal visual-platform acquisition in the  Morris water maze tests. Probe trials confirmed impairments in p97FE65(-/-) mice  in relearning of new spatial information, suggesting a hippocampus-dependent  memory-extinction deficit. Reduced secretion of Abeta peptides was observed in  primary neuronal cultures of hybrids of p97FE65(-/-)/betaPP transgenic (Tg2576)  mice. These studies suggest an important and novel function of FE65 in learning  and memory.

TI Metapopulation persistence with age-dependent disturbance or succession.
SO Science (New York, N.Y.)
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB Simple metapopulation models with random disturbances are used in species  conservation or management, relying on the condition for persistence that the  per-patch colonization rate be greater than the per-patch extinction rate. For a  general model incorporating the role of succession or patch age-dependent  extinction, I show that persistence requires the per-patch colonization rate to  be greater than the inverse of mean patch age, where age is the time since the  patch became available for colonization. Because mean patch age can be  arbitrarily large relative to the extinction rate, currently persisting  metapopulations may be persisting despite small colonization rates, and  management approaches that do not consider the role of mean patch age may  unnecessarily doom populations to extinction.

TI Fidelity and spatio-temporal control in MAP kinase (ERKs) signalling.
SO European journal of biochemistry
LA English
DT Article
AB The mitogen activated protein (MAP) kinase module: (Raf -->MEK-->ERKs) is central  to the control of cell growth, cell differentiation and cell survival. The  fidelity of signalling and the spatio-temporal activation are key determinants in  generating precise biological responses. The fidelity is ensured by scaffold  proteins - protein kinase 'insulators' - and by specific docking sites. The  duration and the intensity of the response are in part controlled by the  compartmentalization of the signalling molecules. Growth factors promote rapid  nuclear translocation and persistent activation of p42/p44 MAP kinases,  respectively and ERK2/ERK1, during the entire G1 period with an extinction during  the S-phase. These features are exquisitely controlled by the temporal induction  of the MAP kinase phosphatases, MKP1-3. MKP1 and 2 induction is strictly  controlled by the activation of the MAP kinase module providing evidence for an  auto-regulatory mechanism. This negative regulatory loop is further enhanced by  the capacity of p42/p44 MAPK to phosphorylate MKP1 and 2. This action reduces the  degradation rate of MKPs through the ubiquitin-proteasomal system. Whereas the  two upstream kinases of the module (Raf and MEK) remain cytoplasmic, ERKs  (anchored to MEK in the cytoplasm of resting cells) rapidly translocate to the  nucleus upon mitogenic stimulation. This latter process is rapid, reversible and  controlled by the strict activation of the MAPK cascade. Following long-term MAPK  stimulation, p42/p44 MAPKs progressively accumulate in the nucleus in an inactive  form. Therefore we propose that the nucleus represents a site for ERK action,  sequestration and signal termination. With the generation of knockdown mice for  each of the ERK isoforms, we will illustrate that besides controlling cell  proliferation the ERK cascade also controls cell differentiation and cell  behaviour.

TI Conservation and control strategies for the wolf (Canis lupus) in western Europe
SO Comptes rendus biologies
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB Securing the long-term acceptance of large carnivores such as the wolf (Canis  lupus) in Europe and North America raises a difficult challenge to conservation  biologists: planning removals to reduce depredations on livestock while ensuring  population viability. We use stochastic-stage-structured population models to  investigate wolf population dynamics and to assess alternative management  strategies. Among the various management strategies advocated by agencies, zoning  that involves eliminating wolves outside a restricted area should be designed  with caution, because probabilities of extinction are extremely sensitive to the  maximum number of packs that a zone can support and to slight changes in stage  specific survival probabilities. In a zoned population, viability is enhanced  more by decreasing mortality rates in all classes than by increasing wolf zone  size. An alternative to zoning is adaptive management, where there is no limit on  pack number but population control can be operated whenever some predefined  demographic conditions are met. It turns out that an adaptive management strategy  that removes a moderate percentage (10%) of the population following each year of  more than 5% of total population growth would provide visible actions addressing  public concerns while keeping extinction probability low.

They were  basic peptides having isoelectric points of over 10. Fa-AMP1 and Fa-AMP2 had  molecular masses of 3,879 Da and 3,906 Da on MALDI-TOF MS analysis, and their  extinction coefficients in 1% aqueous solutions at 280 nm were 42.8 and 38.9,  respectively. Half of all amino acid residues of Fa-AMP1 and Fa-AMP2 were  cysteine and glycine, and they had continuous sequences of cysteine and glycine.  The concentrations of peptides required for 50% inhibition (IC50) of the growth  of plant pathogenic fungi, and Gram-positive and -negative bacteria were 11 to 36  microg/ml. The structural and antimicrobial characteristics of Fa-AMPs indicated  that they are a novel type of antimicrobial peptides belonging to a plant  defensin family.

TI A theoretical and empirical investigation of delayed growth response in the
SO Journal of theoretical biology
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB When the growth of bacteria in a chemostat is controlled by limiting the supply  of a single essential nutrient, the growth rate is affected both by the  concentration of this nutrient in the culture medium and by the amount of time  that it takes for the chemical and physiological processes that result in the  production of new biomass. Thus, although the uptake of nutrient by cells is an  essentially instantaneous process, the addition of new biomass is delayed by the  amount of time that it takes to metabolize the nutrient. Mathematical models that  incorporate this "delayed growth response" (DGR) phenomenon have been developed  and analysed. However, because they are formulated in terms of parameters that  are difficult to measure directly, these models are of limited value to  experimentalists. In this paper, we introduce a DGR model that is formulated in  terms of measurable parameters. In addition, we provide for this model a complete  set of criteria for determining persistence versus extinction of the bacterial  culture in the chemostat. Specifically, we show that DGR plays a role in  determining persistence versus extinction only under certain ranges of chemostat  operating parameters. It is also shown, however, that DGR plays a role in  determining the steady-state nutrient and bacteria concentrations in all  instances of persistence. The steady state and transient behavior of solutions of  our model is found to be in agreement with data that we obtained in growing  Escherichia coli 23716 in a chemostat with glucose as a limiting nutrient. One of  the theoretical predictions of our model that does not occur in other DGR models  is that under certain conditions a large delay in growth response might actually  have a positive effect on the bacteria's ability to persist.

TI Extrinsic versus intrinsic factors in the decline and extinction of Australian
SO Proceedings. Biological sciences
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB Recent attempts to explain the susceptibility of vertebrates to declines  worldwide have largely focused on intrinsic factors such as body size,  reproductive potential, ecological specialization, geographical range and  phylogenetic longevity. Here, we use a database of 145 Australian marsupial  species to test the effects of both intrinsic and extrinsic factors in a  multivariate comparative approach. We model five intrinsic (body size, habitat  specialization, diet, reproductive rate and range size) and four extrinsic  (climate and range overlap with introduced foxes, sheep and rabbits) factors. We  use quantitative measures of geographical range contraction as indices of  decline. We also develop a new modelling approach of phylogenetically independent  contrasts combined with imputation of missing values to deal simultaneously with  phylogenetic structuring and missing data. One extrinsic variable-geographical  range overlap with sheep-was the only consistent predictor of declines. Habitat  specialization was independently but less consistently associated with declines.  This suggests that extrinsic factors largely determine interspecific variation in  extinction risk among Australian marsupials, and that the intrinsic factors that  are consistently associated with extinction risk in other vertebrates are less  important in this group. We conclude that recent anthropogenic changes have been  profound enough to affect species on a continent-wide scale, regardless of their  intrinsic biology.

SO Journal of biomolecular structure & dynamics
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB The acid- and thermostable Sac7d is a small, non-specific DNA-binding protein of  the hyperthermophile archaea Sulfolobus acidocaldarius. In this study, Sac7d was  employed as a structural unit in the design of a thermostable protein containing  two putative DNA-binding domains. By linking two Sac7d proteins together and  comparing the DNA interaction of dimer to that of monomer, this study may provide  structural insights into other dimeric DNA-binding proteins. The engineered  protein, Sac7dK66C, was over-expressed and purified. Dimeric Sac7d was obtained  by cross-linking two mutant Sac7d molecules through the C-terminal disulfide  bond. Thermal stability and DNA-binding ability of dimeric Sac7d were assessed  and compared to those of wild type Sac7d by gel retardation assay, circular  dichroism spectroscopy, and crystallization experiments. Dimeric Sac7d was shown  to be equally thermostable as wild type, and its ability to stabilize DNA duplex  is the same as wild type. However, the interaction of dimeric Sac7d with DNA  diverged from that of wild type, suggesting different DNA-binding modes for  dimeric Sac7d. In addition, a large difference in extinction coefficient was  observed in all dimer/DNA CD spectra, which was reminiscent of the spectrum of  Psi-DNA. Conjugation of various chemical groups to mutant Sac7d is possible  through the C-terminal thiol group. This offers a possible approach in the design  of a thermostable biomolecule with novel functions.

TI Potential biological indicators for glutaraldehyde and formaldehyde sterilization
SO Journal of industrial microbiology & biotechnology
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB The present study aimed to isolate, select, and evaluate bacterial isolates with  potential for use as biological indicators for sterilization with glutaraldehyde  and/or formaldehyde. A total of 340 local Bacillus isolates were screened for  glutaraldehyde and/or formaldehyde resistance by determination of minimum  inhibitory concentrations (MICs), minimum bactericidal concentrations (MBCs), and  extinction time and were compared with B. subtilis (var. niger) ATCC 9372, the  biological indicator for ethylene oxide sterilization, as reference. Of these, 85  isolates had glutaraldehyde MICs of 0.5% or higher, while 29 had formaldehyde  MICs of 0.04% or higher. Of the 29 resistant isolates, 15 had MBCs of 0.05% or  more. Extinction times were used to evaluate the bactericidal/sporicidal activity  of glutaraldehyde. Eight had inactivation times of more than 5 h in 2%  glutaraldehyde (pH 8), whereas 12 had inactivation times of more than 3 h in l%  formaldehyde, with one isolate in common. These 19 isolates were selected and  evaluated as potential biological indicators for aldehydes by determination of  the decimal reduction times ( D values), compared with the reference strain.  Eight glutaraldehyde-resistant isolates exhibited D values 2.0- to 3.5-fold  higher than the reference strain (30 min.). Only five of 12 formaldehyde  resistant isolates had D values higher than that of the reference strain. Using  six resistant isolates, temperature coefficient values between 2.11 and 3.02 were  obtained for 2% formaldehyde. Finally, 14 isolates were tested for potential  pathogenicity and were identified to species level. All of the eight  glutaraldehyde-resistant isolates, including the isolate with dual resistance,  and three formaldehyde-resistant isolates were B. licheniformis, while two other  formaldehyde-resistant isolates were B. cereus. Six of the selected B.  licheniformis isolates are potential biological indicators for sterilization  processes using aldehydes. Three can be suggested for glutaraldehyde only and  three for both aldehydes.

TI Extremophiles and the search for extraterrestrial life.
SO Astrobiology
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB Extremophiles thrive in ice, boiling water, acid, the water core of nuclear  reactors, salt crystals, and toxic waste and in a range of other extreme habitats  that were previously thought to be inhospitable for life. Extremophiles include  representatives of all three domains (Bacteria, Archaea, and Eucarya); however,  the majority are microorganisms, and a high proportion of these are Archaea.  Knowledge of extremophile habitats is expanding the number and types of  extraterrestrial locations that may be targeted for exploration. In addition,  contemporary biological studies are being fueled by the increasing availability  of genome sequences and associated functional studies of extremophiles. This is  leading to the identification of new biomarkers, an accurate assessment of  cellular evolution, insight into the ability of microorganisms to survive in  meteorites and during periods of global extinction, and knowledge of how to  process and examine environmental samples to detect viable life forms. This paper  evaluates extremophiles and extreme environments in the context of astrobiology  and the search for extraterrestrial life.

TI Neuronal activity in the rostral superior colliculus related to the initiation of
SO The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB The extinction of the central fixated stimulus before the appearance of a new  target stimulus reduces the latency of saccades and pursuit, a phenomenon known  as the "gap effect." The superior colliculus (SC) plays a prominent role in the  gap effect for saccades, and recent data indicate that this structure also plays  some role in the control of pursuit. We now show that the firing rate of buildup  neurons in the rostral SC exhibits a gap effect during the initiation of both  pursuit and saccadic eye movements to parafoveal targets. Most neurons exhibited  an increase in tonic activity starting approximately 100 msec after the offset of  the fixation spot, regardless of whether the target later appeared inside or  outside of the response field of the neuron. The subsequent appearance of the  target in the response field evoked phasic increases in activity that were  approximately twice as large as the effects on tonic activity. For both pursuit  and saccades, the levels of tonic and phasic activity were inversely correlated  with latency on a trial-by-trial basis. These changes in activity provide a  neuronal correlate for the shared effects on latency observed previously with the  gap paradigm for pursuit and saccades. Finally, the phasic activity at pursuit  onset exhibited a gap effect just like the target-evoked response, whereas the  burst activity at saccade onset was fixed in amplitude. These results suggest how  SC neurons may coordinate the initiation of pursuit and saccades: buildup  activity may gate the initiation of pursuit, whereas it indirectly triggers  saccades by recruiting a saccade-related burst.

TI Climate change in Australian tropical rainforests: an impending environmental
SO Proceedings. Biological sciences
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB It is now widely accepted that global climate change is affecting many ecosystems  around the globe and that its impact is increasing rapidly. Many studies predict  that impacts will consist largely of shifts in latitudinal and altitudinal  distributions. However, we demonstrate that the impacts of global climate change  in the tropical rainforests of northeastern Australia have the potential to  result in many extinctions. We develop bioclimatic models of spatial distribution  for the regionally endemic rainforest vertebrates and use these models to predict  the effects of climate warming on species distributions. Increasing temperature  is predicted to result in significant reduction or complete loss of the core  environment of all regionally endemic vertebrates. Extinction rates caused by the  complete loss of core environments are likely to be severe, nonlinear, with  losses increasing rapidly beyond an increase of 2 degrees C, and compounded by  other climate-related impacts. Mountain ecosystems around the world, such as the  Australian Wet Tropics bioregion, are very diverse, often with high levels of  restricted endemism, and are therefore important areas of biodiversity. The  results presented here suggest that these systems are severely threatened by  climate change.

TI Some quantitative relationships between leaf area index and canopy nitrogen
SO Annals of botany
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB In a previous study (Yin et al. 2000. Annals of Botany 85: 579-585), a generic  logarithmic equation for leaf area index (L) in relation to canopy nitrogen  content (N) was developed: L=(1/ktn)1n(1+ktnN/nb). The equation has two  parameters: the minimum leaf nitrogen required to support photosynthesis (nb),  and the leaf nitrogen extinction coefficient (ktn). Relative to nb, there is less  information in the literature regarding the variation of ktn. We therefore  derived an equation to theoretically estimate the value of ktn. The predicted  profile of leaf nitrogen in a canopy using this theoretically estimated value of  ktn is slightly more uniform than the profile predicted by the optimum nitrogen  distribution that maximizes canopy photosynthesis. Relative to the optimum  profile, the predicted profile is somewhat closer to the observed one. Based on  the L-N logarithmic equation and the theoretical ktn value, we further quantified  early leaf area development of a canopy in relation to nitrogen using simulation  analysis. In general, there are two types of relations between L and N, which  hold for canopies at different developmental phases. For a fully developed canopy  where the lowest leaves are senescing due to nitrogen shortage, the relationship  between L and N is described well by the logarithmic model above. For a young,  unclosed canopy (i.e. L < 1.0), the relation between L and N is nearly linear.  This linearity is virtually the special case of the logarithmic model when  applied to a young canopy where its total nitrogen content approaches zero and  the amount of nitrogen in its lowest leaves is well above nb. The expected  patterns of the L-N relationship are discussed for the phase of transition from  young to fully developed canopies.

TI Tree balance, time slices, and evolutionary turnover in cretaceous planktonic
SO Systematic biology
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB Studies of phylogenetic tree shape often concentrate on the balance of  phylogenies of extant taxa. Paleontological phylogenies (which include extinct  taxa) can contain additional useful information and can directly document changes  in tree shape through evolutionary time. Unfortunately, the inclusion of extinct  taxa lowers the power of direct examinations of tree balance because it increases  the range of tree shapes expected under null models of evolution (with equal  rates of speciation and extinction across lineages). A promising approach for the  analysis of tree shape in paleontological phylogenies is to break the phylogeny  down into time slices, examining the shape of the phylogeny of taxa alive at each  time slice and changes in that shape between successive time slices. This method  was illustrated with 57 time slices through a stratophenetic phylogeny of the  Cretaceous planktonic foraminiferal superfamily Globotruncanacea. At 3 of 56  intervals between time slices, 93-92.5 million years ago (MYA), 89-88.5 MYA, and  85.5-84 MYA, the group showed steep increases in imbalance. Although none of  these increases were significant after Bonferroni correction, these points in the  history of the Globotruncanacea were nevertheless identified as deserving of  further macroevolutionary investigation. The 84 MYA time slice coincides with a  peak in species turnover for the superfamily. Time slices through phylogenies may  prove useful for identifying periods of time when evolution was proceeding in a  nonstochastic manner.

AB The dynamics of migration of electronic excitations and the efficiency of their  trapping in two-dimensional ensembles of molecules were analyzed. Molecules were  characterized using the following parameters: the width of long-wavelength bands,  the values of extinction and rate constant of deactivation of electronic  excitations, critical distances of migration close to those of dye molecules, in  particular, bacteriochlorophyll a and purple bacteria. A comparative analysis of  two-dimensional models of energy migration made it possible to chose a model with  an optimum light-harvesting on traps from the largest numbers of light-absorbing  molecules. It was shown that in ensembles of molecules having different spectral  characteristics (spectral shifts between the short- and long-wavelength fractions  of the molecules are hear 800 cm-1) the efficiency of excitation trapping is  approximately 90 and 80% for the number of light-harvesting molecules per one  trap 210 and 580, respectively.

TI Differences in susceptibility of various life stages of amphibians to pesticide
SO Aquatic toxicology (Amsterdam, Netherlands)
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB Pesticide exposure is discussed as one of the adverse factor that causes  impairment of amphibian larval development. Susceptibility of tadpoles to  pesticide exposure differs depending on the developmental stages at which  individuals are contaminated. This study focused on the influence of the  pyrethroid insecticide cypermethrin on the hatching success, mortality and  deformities in further development, duration of metamorphosis, and growth of Rana  arvalis tadpoles exposed at various life stages. Eggs were harmed significantly  by exposure to different concentrations of alpha-cypermethrin dependent on  exposure time. Amphibian embryos hatched with apparent abnormalities indicate  insufficient protection by the jelly coat surrounding the embryo. Exposed  individuals exhibited typical signs of cyano pyrethroid poisoning (twisting,  writhing, abnormal swimming). During the life-stage treatments the observed  morphological deformities and behavioral abnormalities lead mostly to death of  the tadpoles in later development. Individuals exposed to alpha-cypermethrin in  early life stages (as eggs or newly hatched tadpoles) metamorphosed earlier than  in the corresponding control. However, exposure of the tadpoles throughout their  whole development prolonged the metamorphosis. These metamorphs were  distinguished by a much more compact physique (significant reduction in length  and significant increase in weight compared to the corresponding control) so as  to resist the adverse conditions. Observed effects of alpha-cypermethrin exposure  on various life stages of R. arvalis tadpoles refer to the danger potential of  this insecticide for amphibian development. Any kind of deformation influences  the physiological fitness of the individuals (e.g. increased vulnerability to  predation). Diminished hatching success, delays in metamorphosis and body growth  impact negatively on the viability of amphibian populations in the long term. In  combination with other anthropogenic influences (destruction or dissipation of  habitats), these effects can cause the local extinction of amphibian species.

TI Minimum recruitment frequency in plants with episodic recruitment.
SO Oecologia
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB There is concern about the lack of recruitment of Acacia trees in the Negev  desert of Israel. We have developed three models to estimate the frequency of  recruitment necessary for long-term population survival (i.e. positive average  population growth for 1,000 years and < 10% probability of extinction). Two  models assume purely episodic recruitment based on the general notion that  recruitment in arid environments is highly episodic. They differ in that the  deterministic model investigates average dynamics while the stochastic model does  not. Studies indicating that recruitment episodes in arid environments have been  overemphasized motivated the development of the third model. This semi-stochastic  model simulates a mixture of continuous and episodic recruitment. Model analysis  was done analytically for the deterministic model and via running model  simulations for the stochastic and semi-stochastic models. The deterministic and  stochastic models predict that, on average, 2.2 and 3.7 recruitment events per  century, respectively, are necessary to sustain the population. According to the  semi-stochastic model, 1.6 large recruitment events per century and an annual  probability of 50% that a small recruitment event occurs are needed. A  consequence of purely episodic recruitment is that all recruitment episodes  produce extremely large numbers of recruits (i.e. at odds with field  observations), an evaluation that holds even when considering that rare events  must be large. Thus, the semi-stochastic model appears to be the most realistic  model. Comparing the prediction of the semi-stochastic model to field  observations in the Negev desert shows that the absence of observations of  extremely large recruitment events is no reason for concern. However, the almost  complete absence of small recruitment events is a serious reason for concern. The  lack of recruitment may be due to decreased densities of large mammalian  herbivores and might be further exacerbated by possible changes in climate, both  in terms of average precipitation and the temporal distribution of rain.

TI The evolutionary inheritance of elemental stoichiometry in marine phytoplankton.
SO Nature
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB Phytoplankton is a nineteenth century ecological construct for a biologically  diverse group of pelagic photoautotrophs that share common metabolic functions  but not evolutionary histories. In contrast to terrestrial plants, a major schism  occurred in the evolution of the eukaryotic phytoplankton that gave rise to two  major plastid superfamilies. The green superfamily appropriated chlorophyll b,  whereas the red superfamily uses chlorophyll c as an accessory photosynthetic  pigment. Fossil evidence suggests that the green superfamily dominated Palaeozoic  oceans. However, after the end-Permian extinction, members of the red superfamily  rose to ecological prominence. The processes responsible for this shift are  obscure. Here we present an analysis of major nutrients and trace elements in 15  species of marine phytoplankton from the two superfamilies. Our results indicate  that there are systematic phylogenetic differences in the two plastid types where  macronutrient (carbon:nitrogen:phosphorus) stoichiometries primarily reflect  ancestral pre-symbiotic host cell phenotypes, but trace element composition  reflects differences in the acquired plastids. The compositional differences  between the two plastid superfamilies suggest that changes in ocean redox state  strongly influenced the evolution and selection of eukaryotic phytoplankton since  the Proterozoic era.

TI A spatially explicit individual-based model of reinforcement in hybrid zones.
SO Evolution; international journal of organic evolution
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB An individual-based model consisting of two dioecious populations in a  two-dimensional environmental grid was constructed. Each population began with,  and never exceeded, 1000 individuals; extinction was allowed. Genomes consisting  of 30 biallelic loci for male sexual advertisement call, female mate preference,  and population origin were constructed, and lineages of each individual in the  starting populations were followed for 2000 generations. Type and level of hybrid  disadvantage, initial population distribution, patchiness of environmental  resources, and level of mate choice were varied. Persistence of bimodal hybrid  zones was nonexistent at low levels of hybrid disadvantage and universal at high  levels of hybrid disadvantage, with a narrow threshold in which persistence was  unpredictable. Persistence occurred at lower levels of hybrid disadvantage when  populations were initially parapatric rather than sympatric, and environments  were patchy rather than homogeneous. Increased divergence in mating systems  occurred when hybrid disadvantage was high, hybrids were infertile, populations  were initially parapatric, and increased female choice was allowed. Mating system  divergence was much higher in interacting populations compared with  noninteracting populations, indicating that reinforcement caused most of the  observed divergence. When hybrids were infertile, reinforcement contributed to  speciation, because under hybrid infertility the probability of persistence at  low levels of hybrid disadvantage was positively related to mate choice. The  results agree with previous one-dimensional spatial models in finding that  population persistence is more likely in parapatric and patchy population  distributions. In addition, the results show that hybrid infertility may  facilitate the process of reinforcement and speciation.

TI Dynamics and genealogy of strains in spatially extended host-pathogen models.
SO Journal of theoretical biology
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB We examine the dynamics of evolution in a generic spatial model of a pathogen  infecting a population of hosts, or an analogous predator-prey system. Previous  studies of this model have found a range of interesting phenomena that differ  from the well-mixed version. We extend these studies by examining the spatial and  temporal dynamics of strains using genealogical tracing. When transmissibility  can evolve by mutation, strains of intermediate transmissibility dominate even  though high-transmissibility mutants have a short-term reproductive advantage.  Mutant strains continually arise and grow rapidly for many generations but  eventually go extinct before dominating the system. We find that, after a number  of generations, the mutant pathogen characteristics strongly impact the spatial  distribution of their local host environment, even when there are diverse types  coexisting. Extinction is due to the depletion of susceptibles in the local  environment of these mutant strains. Studies of spatial and genealogical  relatedness reveal the self-organized spatial clustering of strains that enables  their impact on the local environment. Thus, we find that selection acts against  the high-transmissibility strains on long time-scales as a result of the feedback  due to environmental change. Our study shows that averages over space or time  should not be assumed to adequately describe the evolutionary dynamics of  spatially distributed host-pathogen systems.

TI Spatial grain and the causes of regional diversity gradients in ants.
SO The American naturalist
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB Gradients of species richness (S; the number of species of a given taxon in a  given area and time) are ubiquitous. A key goal in ecology is to understand  whether and how the many processes that generate these gradients act at different  spatial scales. Here we evaluate six hypotheses for diversity gradients with 49  New World ant communities, from tundra to rain forest. We contrast their  performance at three spatial grains from S(plot), the average number of ant  species nesting in a m2 plot, through Fisher's alpha, an index that treats our 30  1-m2 plots as subsamples of a locality's diversity. At the smallest grain,  S(plot), was tightly correlated (r2 = 0.99) with colony abundance in a fashion  indistinguishable from the packing of randomly selected individuals into a fixed  space. As spatial grain increased, the coaction of two factors linked to high net  rates of diversification--warm temperatures and large areas of uniform  climate--accounted for 75% of the variation in Fisher's alpha. However, the  mechanisms underlying these correlations (i.e., precisely how temperature and  area shape the balance of speciation to extinction) remain elusive.

TI Metapopulation-level adaptation of insect host plant preference and
SO Theoretical population biology
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB Species living in highly fragmented landscapes typically occur as metapopulations  with frequent turnover of local populations. The turnover rate depends on  population sizes and connectivities, but it may also depend on the phenotypic and  genotypic composition of populations. The Glanville fritillary butterfly  (Melitaea cinxia) in Finland uses two host plant species, which show variation in  their relative abundances at two spatial scales: locally among individual habitat  patches and regionally among networks of patches. Female butterflies in turn  exhibit spatial variation in genetically determined host plant preference within  and among patch networks. Emigration, immigration and establishment of new  populations have all been shown to be strongly influenced by the match between  the host plant composition of otherwise suitable habitat patches and the host  plant preference of migrating butterflies. The evolutionary consequences of such  biased migration and colonization with respect to butterfly phenotypes might  differ depending on spatial configuration and plant species composition of the  patches in heterogeneous patch networks. Using a spatially realistic  individual-based model we show that the model-predicted evolution of host plant  preference due to biased migration explains a significant amount of the observed  variation in host plant use among metapopulations living in dissimilar networks.  This example illustrates how the ecological extinction-colonization dynamics may  be linked with the evolutionary dynamics of life history traits in  metapopulations.

TI Explaining the end of the hominoid experiment in Europe.
SO Journal of human evolution
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB The Vallesian Crisis involved the extinction of most of the hominoids that  settled successfully in Europe during the middle and early Late Miocene,  including Dryopithecus, Ankarapithecus and Graecopithecus. This event has been  dated at 9.6 Ma, predating by more than one million years the spread of the C4  grasses and the retreat of forests over large parts of the globe at 7-8 Ma. The  finding of macrofloral remains in the Terrassa section (Vallès-Penedès Basin)  sheds new light on the nature of vegetational change associated with the hominoid  extinction. This section presents an abundant late Vallesian vertebrate fauna and  has been accurately dated at 9.2 - 9 Ma by paleomagnetism. Therefore, it provides  the best indication of the kind of vegetation that occupied the area after the  Vallesian Crisis. It is suggested that the extinction of the late Miocene Western  European hominoids was not related to the spread of grasses, but to a significant  increase of a floral association dominated by deciduous trees.

TI The maintenance of sex in parasites.
SO Proceedings. Biological sciences
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB The maintenance of sex is an unresolved paradox in evolutionary biology, given  the inherent twofold fitness advantage for asexuals. Parasitic helminths offer a  unique opportunity to address this enigma. Parasites that can create novel  antigenic strains are able to escape pre-existing host immunity. Viruses produce  diversity through mutation with rapid clonal proliferation. The long generation  times of helminth parasites prevent them from adopting this strategy. Instead, we  argue that sexual reproduction enables parasitic helminths to rapidly generate  strain diversity. We use both a stochastic, individual-based model and a simple  analytical model to assess the selective value of sexual versus asexual  reproduction in helminth parasites. We demonstrate that sexual reproduction can  more easily produce and maintain strain diversity than asexual reproduction for  long-lived parasites. We also show that sexual parasite populations are resistant  to invasion by rare asexual mutants. These results are robust to high levels of  cross-immunity between strains. We suggest that the enhancement of strain  diversity, despite stochastic extinction of strains, may be critical to the  evolutionary success of sex in long-lived parasites.

TI Quasi-steady state approximation to a fungal growth model.
SO IMA journal of mathematics applied in medicine and biology
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB In a previous paper, we proposed a fungal growth model (Lamour et al., 2001 IMA  J. Math. Appl. Med. Biol., 17, 329-346), describing the colonization and  decomposition of substrate, subsequent uptake of nutrients, and incorporation  into fungal biomass, and performed an overall-steady-state analysis. In this  paper we assume that where nutrient dynamics are much faster than the dynamics of  fungal biomass and substrate, the system will reach a quasi-steady-state  relatively quickly. We show how the quasi-steady-state approximation is a  simplification of the full fungal growth model. We then derive an explicit fungal  invasion criterion, which was not possible for the full model, and characterize  parameter domains for invasion and extinction. Importantly, the fungal invasion  criterion takes two forms: one for systems where carbon is limiting, another for  systems where nitrogen is limiting. We focus attention on what happens in the  short term immediately following the introduction of a fungus to a fungal-free  system by analysing the stability of the trivial steady state, and then check  numerically whether the fungus is able to persist. The derived invasion criterion  was found to be valid also for the full model. Knowledge of the factors that  determine invasion is essential to an understanding of fungal dynamics. The  simplified model allows the invasion criterion to be tested with experimental  data.

TI Procerain, a stable cysteine protease from the latex of Calotropis procera.
SO Phytochemistry
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB A protease was purified to homogeneity from the latex of medicinal plant  Calotropis procera (Family-Asclepiadaceae). The molecular mass and isoelectric  point of the enzyme are 28.8 kDa and 9.32, respectively. Hydrolysis of azoalbumin  by the enzyme was optimal in the range of pH 7.0-9.0 and temperature 55-60 degree  C. The enzyme hydrolyses denatured natural substrates like casein, azoalbumin,  and azocasein with high specific activity. Proteolytic and amidolytic activities  of the enzyme were activated by thiol protease activators and inhibited by thiol  protease inhibitors, indicating the enzyme to be a cysteine protease. The enzyme  named as procerain, cleaves N-succinyl-Ala-Ala-Ala-p-nitroanilide but not  -Ala-Ala-p-nitroanilide, -Ala p-nitroanilide and N-d-Benzoyl--Arg-p-nitroanilide  and appears to be peptide length dependent. The extinction coefficient (epsilon  1% 280 nm) of the enzyme was 24.9 and it had no detectable carbohydrate moiety.  Procerain contains eight tryptophan, 20 tyrosine and seven cysteine residues  forming three disulfide bridges, and the remaining one being free. Procerain  retains full activity over a broad range of pH 3.0-12.0 and temperatures up to 70  degree C, besides being stable at very high concentrations of chemical  denaturants and organic solvents. Polyclonal antibodies against procerain do not  cross-react with other related proteases. Procerain unlike most of the plant  cysteine proteases has blocked N-terminal residue.

SO Experimental & applied acarology
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB To investigate the relative contributions of bottom-up (plant condition) and  top-down (predatory mites) factors on the dynamics of the two-spotted spider mite  (Tetranychus urticae), a series of experiments were conducted in which spider  mites and predatory mites were released on bean plants. Plants inoculated with 2,  4, 8, 16, and 32 adult female T. urticae were either left untreated or were  inoculated with 3 or 5 adult female predators (Phytoseiulus persimilis) one week  after the introduction of spider mites. Plant area, densities of T. urticae and  P. persimilis, and plant injury were assessed by weekly sampling. Data were  analysed by a combination of statistical methods and a tri-trophic mechanistic  simulation model partly parameterised from the current experiments and partly  from previous data. The results showed a clear effect of predators on the density  of spider mites and on the plant injury they cause. Plant injury increased with  the initial number of spider mites and decreased with the initial number of  predators. Extinction of T. urticae, followed by extinction of P. persimilis, was  the most likely outcome for most initial combinations of prey and predators. Eggs  constituted a relatively smaller part of the prey population as plant injury  increased and of the predator population as prey density decreased. We did not  find statistical evidence of P. persimilis having preference for feeding on T.  urticae eggs. The simulation model demonstrated that bottom-up and top-down  factors interact synergistically to reduce the density of spider mites. This may  have important implications for biological control of spider mites by means of  predatory mites.

TI Quantification of the effect of control strategies on classical swine fever
SO Mathematical biosciences
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB Emergency vaccination during an epidemic of classical swine fever virus (CSFV)  has become a serious option because of the ethical problems of strategies with  massive culling and the availability of a marker vaccine that reduces virus  transmission. Here we present a model of between-herd CSFV transmission, which  quantifies the effect of control strategies with and without vaccination. We  estimate the model parameters from data of the Dutch CSFV epidemic of 1997/1998.  With the model, a set of control strategies is compared, consisting of five  control measures in several combinations. Consequently, the following general  requirements of successful strategies can be formulated. First, to achieve  extinction of a CSFV epidemic, transmission through transport should be prevented  and the indirect virus transmission, i.e. all transmission not through animal  contacts, should at least be halved, either by vaccination or by culling of the  susceptible pig population. Second, to minimize the size and duration of an  epidemic, the extinction requirements should be met quickly and indirect virus  transmission should be reduced by far more than a half. Although the origin of  the model parameters let the requirements in fact be only applicable for the  south-eastern part of the Netherlands, it is argued that epidemics in other areas  will not need stricter control strategies.

TI A complete classification of Darwinian extinction in ecological interactions.
SO The American naturalist
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB The evolution of a population by individual-level natural selection can result in  the population's extinction. Selection causes the spread of phenotypes with  higher relative fitness, but at the same time, selection can also indirectly  produce changes in the physical, biotic, or genotypical environment through  population interactions (e.g., environment modification, interspecific  interactions, and genomic conflict). Because fitness is environment dependent,  this can cause mean fitness to decrease, resulting in extinction. I call this  process "Darwinian extinction." Examples of Darwinian extinction include a  variety of dynamics and modes of extinction, but the variation is constrained. I  determine the complete classification of possible dynamics and modes of Darwinian  extinction due to ecological interactions, using bifurcation theory and models  with ecological and evolutionary changes occurring on different timescales. This  classification is also extended to extinctions due to interactions within the  population. The mode of extinction may be either sudden or gradual (requiring  additional stochastic processes), and each mode has specific types of dynamics  associated with it. Darwinian extinction is a robust and normal phenomenon, and  this reasonably complete classification can help us understand more thoroughly  its role in nature.

TI Sexual selection and the risk of extinction in birds.
SO Proceedings. Biological sciences
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB The relationship between sexual selection and extinction risk has rarely been  investigated. This is unfortunate because extinction plays a key role in  determining the patterns of species richness seen in extant clades, which form  the basis of comparative studies into the role that sexual selection may play in  promoting speciation. We investigate the extent to which the perceived risk of  extinction relates to four different estimates of sexual selection in 1030  species of birds. We find no evidence that the number of threatened species is  distributed unevenly according to a social mating system, and neither of our two  measures of pre-mating sexual selection (sexual dimorphism and dichromatism) was  related to extinction risk, after controlling for phylogenetic inertia. However,  threatened species apparently experience more intense post-mating sexual  selection, measured as testis size, than non-threatened species. These results  persisted after including body size as a covariate in the analysis, and became  even stronger after controlling for clutch size (two known correlates of  extinction risk). Sexual selection may therefore be a double-edged  process-promoting speciation on one hand but promoting extinction on the other.  Furthermore, we suggest that it is post-mating sexual selection, in particular,  that is responsible for the negative effect of sexual selection on clade size.  Why this might be is unclear, but the mean population fitness of species with  high intensities of post-mating sexual selection may be especially low if costs  associated with multiple mating are high or if the selection load imposed by  post-mating selection is higher relative to that of pre-mating sexual selection.

DT Journal Article
AB In the perspective of reversing multidrug resistance through antisense strategy  while avoiding non-antisense effects of all-phosphorothioate oligonucleotides  which non-specifically bind to proteins, a minimally modified antisense  phosphodiester oligodeoxyribonucleotide has been designed against mdr1, one of  the multidrug resistance genes. Its stability in lysates prepared from NIH/3T3  cells transfected with the human mdr1 gene has already been demonstrated.  Confocal microspectrofluorometry using a fluorescence resonance energy transfer  technique allowed its stability inside living cells to be proven. Its  internalization into the cells was achieved with different delivery agents  (addition of a cholesteryl group, Superfect or an amphotericin B cationic  derivative) and has been followed by fluorescence imaging. For each of the  delivery systems, Western blotting allowed its antisense efficiency to be  compared to that of an all-phosphorothioate antisense oligonucleotide. No  antisense efficiency was demonstrated for the minimally modified ODN when  internalized with Superfect. In both other cases, the best extinction of the  P-glycoprotein expression has always been achieved with the all-phosphorothioate  antisense. While the difference was significant in the case the amphotericin B  derivative was used as delivery agent (20% remaining protein expression with the  all-phosphorothioate vs. 40% with the minimally modified antisense), it was  negligible for the cholesterol conjugates (2% vs. 6%). It is of great interest to  prove that an almost all-phosphodiester oligonucleotide can be an efficient  antisense against an overexpressed gene. The reduction of non-antisense effects  as non-specific binding to proteins are of importance in the case relatively high  ODN concentrations are used, which can prove to be necessary in the case of  overexpressed genes.

TI Cenozoic bolide impacts and biotic change in North American mammals.

LA English
DT Journal Article
AB North American mammals experienced a major mass extinction at the  Cretaceous/Tertiary (K/T) boundary that is tied unambiguously to the Chicxulub  impact event. Immediately afterwards, there was an immense adaptive radiation  that greatly expanded taxonomic diversity and the range of body sizes and  ecological strategies. However, ties between later, Cenozoic impact events and  specific episodes in mammalian evolution cannot be demonstrated. A time series of  maximum known crater sizes within 1.0-million-year-long temporal bins is shown  not to cross-correlate with five separate measures of taxonomic turnover rate,  one measure of change in relative taxonomic composition, and four measures of  change in body mass distributions. The lack of correlation persists even after  excluding the volatile Paleocene mammalian data, adding dummy data to represent  intervals without known craters, or lagging the time series against each other  for up to 5 million years. Furthermore, the data fail to support broad-brush  correspondences between ages of major (>20 km in diameter) craters and the timing  of five key, post-K/T biotic transitions, including medium-sized extinction  episodes during the late Paleocene and latest Miocene. The results challenge the  idea that extraterrestrial impacts drive all, most, or even many extinction and  radiation episodes in terrestrial organisms, and add to other evidence that  natural, long-term biotic changes are often independent of changes in the  physical environment.

TI Sporormiella and the late Holocene extinctions in Madagascar.
SO Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB Fossil spores of the dung fungus Sporormiella spp. in sediment cores from  throughout Madagascar provide new information concerning megafaunal extinction  and the introduction of livestock. Sporormiella percentages are very high in  prehuman southwest Madagascar, but at the site with best stratigraphic resolution  the spore declines sharply by approximately 1,720 yr B.P. (radiocarbon years  ago). Within a few centuries there is a concomitant rise in microscopic charcoal  that probably represents human transformation of the local environment. Reduced  megaherbivore biomass in wooded savannas may have resulted in increased plant  biomass and more severe fires. Some now-extinct taxa persisted locally for a  millennium or more after the inferred megafaunal decline. Sites in closed humid  forests of northwest Madagascar and a montane ericoid formation of the central  highlands show only low to moderate Sporormiella percentages before humans. A  subsequent rise in spore concentrations, thought to be evidence for livestock  proliferation, occurs earliest at Amparihibe in the northwest at approximately  1,130 yr B.P.

TI A technique for estimating maximum harvesting effort in a stochastic fishery
SO Journal of biosciences
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB Exploitation of biological resources and the harvest of population species are  commonly practiced in fisheries, forestry and wild life management. Estimation of  maximum harvesting effort has a great impact on the economics of fisheries and  other bio-resources. The present paper deals with the problem of a bioeconomic  fishery model under environmental variability. A technique for finding the  maximum harvesting effort in fluctuating environment has been developed in a  two-species competitive system, which shows that under realistic environmental  variability the maximum harvesting effort is less than what is estimated in the  deterministic model. This method also enables us to find out the safe regions in  the parametric space for which the chance of extinction of the species is  minimized. A real life fishery problem has been considered to obtain the  inaccessible parameters of the system in a systematic way. Such studies may help  resource managers to get an idea for controlling the system.

LA English
DT Journal Article
AB Continental flood basalt (CFB) volcanism is hypothesized to have played a  causative role in global climate change and mass extinctions. Uncertainties  associated with radiometric dating preclude a clear chronological assessment of  the environmental consequences of CFB volcanism. Our results document a 25%  decline in the marine 187Os/188Os record that predates the Cretaceous-Tertiary  boundary (KTB) and coincides with late Maastrichtian warming. We argue that this  decline provides a chemostratigraphic marker of Deccan volcanism and thus  constitutes compelling evidence that the main environmental consequence of Deccan  volcanism was a transient global warming event of 3 degrees to 5 degrees C that  is fully resolved from the KTB mass extinction.

AB Conservation genetics encompasses genetic management of small populations,  resolution of taxonomic uncertainties and management units, and the use of  molecular genetic analyses in forensics and to understanding species' biology.  The role of genetic factors in extinctions of wild populations has been  controversial, but evidence now shows that they make important contributions to  extinction risk. Inbreeding has been shown to cause extinctions of wild  populations, computer projections indicate that inbreeding depression has  important effects on extinction risk, and most threatened species show signs of  genetic deterioration. Inappropriate management is likely to result if genetic  factors are ignored in threatened species management.

TI Coexistence in a competitive parasitoid-host system.
SO Journal of theoretical biology
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB The main objective of this work is to determine the conditions for coexistence  and competitive exclusion in a discrete model for a community of three species: a  stage-structured host and two competing parasitoids sharing the same host  developmental stage. Coexistence of the community of the species is found to  depend on the host life history parameters in the first place, and on competitive  ability and parasitoid efficiency in the second place. In particular, parasitoids  equilibrium densities are defined by the size of the refuge. Extinction is  expected with low growth rate and with low adult survival. Host life histories  are also associated with oscillations in population density, and depending on the  combination of host adult survival from one generation to the next and host  growth rate, the minimum of fluctuations approaches zero, implying a higher  potential risk of extinction because of stochastic factors. Our results suggest  that equally reduced survival of parasitoids in hosts parasitized by both species  determines extinction of the parasitoid with lower population density, in  contrast to the case when both parasitoids benefit with 50% of all doubly  parasitized hosts, leading to the hypothesis that a community where competitors  in multiparasitized hosts die, easily becomes extinct. Competitive exclusion is  expected for highly asymmetric competitive interactions, independent of  population densities, allowing us to hypothesize that coexistence of competitors  in systems with limited resources and refuges is associated with a clearly  defined competitive hierarchy.

TI Origin of the superflock of cichlid fishes from Lake Victoria, East Africa.
SO Science (New York, N.Y.)
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB Lake Victoria harbors a unique species-rich flock of more than 500 endemic  haplochromine cichlid fishes. The origin, age, and mechanism of diversification  of this extraordinary radiation are still debated. Geological evidence suggests  that the lake dried out completely about 14,700 years ago. On the basis of  phylogenetic analyses of almost 300 DNA sequences of the mitochondrial control  region of East African cichlids, we find that the Lake Victoria cichlid flock is  derived from the geologically older Lake Kivu. We suggest that the two seeding  lineages may have already been lake-adapted when they colonized Lake Victoria. A  haplotype analysis further shows that the most recent desiccation of Lake  Victoria did not lead to a complete extinction of its endemic cichlid fauna and  that the major lineage diversification took place about 100,000 years ago.

TI Modelling the effect of diffuse light on canopy photosynthesis in controlled
SO Acta horticulturae

DT Journal Article
DE NASA Discipline Life Support Systems; Non-NASA Center
AB A layered canopy model was used to analyze the effects of diffuse light on canopy  gross photosynthesis in controlled environment plant growth chambers, where, in  contrast to the field, highly diffuse light can occur at high irradiance. The  model suggests that high diffuse light fractions (approximately 0.7) and  irradiance (1400 micromoles m-2 s-1) may enhance crop life-cycle canopy gross  photosynthesis for hydroponic wheat by about 20% compared to direct light at the  same irradiance. Our simulations suggest that high accuracy is not needed in  specifying diffuse light fractions in chambers between approximately 0.7 and 1,  because simulated photosynthesis for closed canopies plateau in this range. We  also examined the effect of leaf angle distribution on canopy photosynthesis  under growth chamber conditions, as these distributions determine canopy  extinction coefficients for direct and diffuse light. We show that the spherical  leaf angle distribution is not suitable for modeling photosynthesis of planophile  canopies (e.g., soybean and peanut) in growth chambers. Also, the absorption of  the light reflected from the surface below the canopy should generally be  included in model simulations, as the corresponding albedo values in the  photosynthetically active range may be quite high in growth chambers (e.g.,  approximately 0.5). In addition to the modeling implications, our results suggest  that diffuse light conditions should be considered when drawing conclusions from  experiments in controlled environments.

TI Introduced species and their missing parasites.
SO Nature
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB Damage caused by introduced species results from the high population densities  and large body sizes that they attain in their new location. Escape from the  effects of natural enemies is a frequent explanation given for the success of  introduced species. Because some parasites can reduce host density and decrease  body size, an invader that leaves parasites behind and encounters few new  parasites can experience a demographic release and become a pest. To test whether  introduced species are less parasitized, we have compared the parasites of exotic  species in their native and introduced ranges, using 26 host species of molluscs,  crustaceans, fishes, birds, mammals, amphibians and reptiles. Here we report that  the number of parasite species found in native populations is twice that found in  exotic populations. In addition, introduced populations are less heavily  parasitized (in terms of percentage infected) than are native populations.  Reduced parasitization of introduced species has several causes, including  reduced probability of the introduction of parasites with exotic species (or  early extinction after host establishment), absence of other required hosts in  the new location, and the host-specific limitations of native parasites adapting  to new hosts.

TI Autocatalytic reactions of phase distributed active particles.

DT Journal Article
AB We investigate the effect of asynchronism of autocatalytic reactions taking place  in open hydrodynamical flows, by assigning a phase to each particle in the system  to differentiate the timing of the reaction, while the reaction rate  (periodicity) is kept unchanged. The chaotic saddle in the flow dynamics acts as  a catalyst and enhances the reaction in the same fashion as in the case of a  synchronous reaction that was studied previously, proving that the same type of  nonlinear reaction kinetics is valid in the phase-distributed situation. More  importantly, we show that, in a certain range of a parameter, the phenomenon of  phase selection can occur, when a group of particles with a particular phase is  favored over the others, thus occupying a larger fraction of the available space,  or eventually leading to the extinction of the unfavored phases. We discuss the  biological relevance of this latter phenomenon. (c) 2002 American Institute of  Physics.

TI The role of density-dependent dispersal in source-sink dynamics.
SO Journal of theoretical biology
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB I investigate two aspects of source-sink theory that have hitherto received  little attention: density-dependent dispersal and the cost of dispersal to  sources. The cost arises because emigration reduces the per capita growth rate of  sources, thus predisposing them to extinction. I show that source-sink  persistence depends critically on the interplay between these two factors. When  the emigration rate increases with abundance at an accelerating rate, dispersal  costs to sources is the lowest and risk of source-sink extinction the least. When  the emigration rate increases with abundance at a decelerating rate, dispersal  costs to sources is the highest and the risk of source-sink extinction the  greatest. Density-independent emigration has an intermediate effect. Thus,  density-dependent dispersal per se does not increase or decrease source-sink  persistence relative to density-independent dispersal. The exact mode of  dispersal is crucial. A key point to appreciate is that these effects of  dispersal on source-sink extinction arise from the temporal density-dependence  that dispersal induces in the per capita growth rates of source and sink  populations. Temporal density-dependence due to dispersal is beneficial at low  abundances because it rescues sinks from extinction, and detrimental at high  abundances because it drives otherwise viable sources to extinction. These  results are robust to the nature of population dynamics in the sink, whether  exponential or logistic. They provide a means of assessing the relative costs and  benefits of preserving sink habitats given three biological parameters.

SO The American naturalist
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB Environmental variability is a ubiquitous feature of every organism's habitat.  However, the interaction between density dependence and those density-independent  factors that are manifested as environmental noise is poorly understood. We are  interested in the conditions under which noise interacts with the density  dependence to cause amplification of that noise when filtered by the system. For  a broad family of structured population models, we show that amplification occurs  near the threshold from stable to unstable dynamics by deriving an analytic  formula for the amplification under weak noise. We confirm that the effect of  noise is to sustain oscillations that would otherwise decay, and we show that it  is the amplitude and not the phase that is affected. This is a feature noted in  several recent studies. We study this phenomenon in detail for the lurchin and  LPA models of population dynamics. We find that the degree of amplification is  sensitive to both the noise input and life-history stage through which it acts,  that the results hold for surprisingly high levels of noise, and that stochastic  chaos (as measured by local Lyapunov exponents) is a concomitant feature of  amplification. Further, it is shown that the temporal autocorrelation, or  "color," of the noise has a major impact on the system response. We discuss the  conditions under which color increases population variance and hence the risk of  extinction, and we show that periodicity is sharpened when the color of the noise  and dynamics coincide. Otherwise, there is interference, which shows how  difficult it is in practice to separate the effects of nonlinearity and noise in  short time series. The sensitivity of the population dynamics to noise when close  to a bifurcation has wide-ranging consequences for the evolution and ecology of  population dynamics.

TI Risk management in biological evolution.
SO Journal of theoretical biology
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB I present a framework to study the evolution of traits that allow an organism to  survive life-threatening but rare risks. Specifically, I am concerned with risks  so rare that any one individual in a population may not experience the  risk-causing event in its lifetime. A theory of rare risk management is virtually  absent in evolutionary biology, although it is well developed in economics. This  is surprising because of the great influence economics had on evolutionary  biology, and because biology is full of examples for evolved risk management  traits. They include the ability of bacteria to sporulate, of pathogens to  survive antibiotic treatment, of temperate bacteriophages to enter a lytic life  cycle, as well as traits that allow higher organisms to survive rare  environmental disasters, such as sporadic wildfires and irregular flooding. I  make predictions about the sustenance of risk management traits under two  scenarios, one where the catastrophic events cause individual deaths, and another  one where catastrophic events cause population extinction. A well-developed  theory of risk management will not only predict the distribution of risk  management traits, but may also serve other purposes, such as to reconstruct the  spectrum of environments that an organism encountered in its evolutionary history  from the record stored in its genome's memory.

TI Ecological dynamics of mutualist/antagonist communities.
SO The American naturalist
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB One approach to understanding how mutualisms function in community settings is to  model well-studied pairwise interactions in the presence of the few species with  which they interact most strongly. In nature, such species are often specialized  antagonists of one or both mutualists. Hence, these models can also shed light on  the problem of when and how mutualisms are able to persist in the face of  exploitation. We used spatial stochastic simulations to model the ecological  dynamics of obligate, species-specific mutualisms between plants and pollinating  seed parasite insects (e.g., yuccas and yucca moths) in the presence of one of  two obligate antagonist species: flower-feeding insects (florivores) or insects  that parasitize seeds but fail to pollinate (exploiters). Our results suggest  that mutualisms can persist surprisingly well in the presence of highly  specialized antagonists but that they exhibit distinctly different temporal and  spatial dynamics when antagonists are present. In our models, antagonists tend to  induce oscillations in the mutualist populations. As the number of per capita  visits by antagonists increase, the system's oscillatory dynamics become more  extreme, finally leading to the extinction of one or more of the three species.  When the antagonists exhibit high per capita visitation frequencies and long  dispersal distances, significant spatial patchiness emerges within these  tripartite interactions. We found surprisingly little difference between the  ecological effects of florivores and exploiters, although in general florivores  tended to drive themselves (and sometimes the mutualists) to extinction at  parameter values at which the exploiters were able to persist. These theoretical  results suggest several testable hypotheses regarding the ecological and  evolutionary persistence of mutualisms. More broadly, they point to the critical  importance of studying the dynamics of pairwise interactions in community  contexts.

DT Review
AB Memory retrieval is a fundamental component or stage of memory processing. In  fact, retrieval is the only possible measure of memory. The ability to recall  past events is a major determinant of survival strategies in all species and is  of paramount importance in determining our uniqueness as individuals. Most  biological studies of memory using brain lesion and/or gene manipulation  techniques cannot distinguish between effects on the molecular mechanisms of the  encoding or consolidation of memories and those responsible for their retrieval  from storage. Here we examine recent findings indicating the major molecular  steps involved in memory retrieval in selected brain regions of the mammalian  brain. Together the findings strongly suggest that memory formation and retrieval  may share some molecular mechanisms in the hippocampus and that retrieval  initiates extinction requiring activation of several signaling cascades and  protein synthesis.

TI Space and the persistence of male-killing endosymbionts in insect populations.
SO Proceedings. Biological sciences
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB Male-killing bacteria are bacteria that are transmitted vertically through the  females of their insect hosts. They can distort the sex ratio of their hosts by  killing infected male offspring. In nature, male-killing endosymbionts (male  killers) often have a 100% efficient vertical transmission, and multiple  male-killing bacteria infecting a single population are observed. We use  different model formalisms to study these observations. In mean-field models a  male killer with perfect transmission drives the host population to extinction,  and coexistence between multiple male killers within one population is  impossible; however, in spatially explicit models, both phenomena are readily  observed. We show how the spatial pattern formation underlies these results. In  the case of high transmission efficiencies, waves with a high density of male  killers alternate with waves of mainly wild-type hosts. The male killers cause  local extinction, but this creates an opportunity for uninfected hosts to  re-invade these areas. Spatial pattern formation also creates an opportunity for  two male killers to coexist within one population: different strains create  spatial regions that are qualitatively different; these areas then serve as  different niches, making coexistence possible.

TI Gold nanolayer-encapsulated silica particles synthesized by surface seeding and
SO Journal of colloid and interface science
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB Gold nanolayer-encapsulated silica particles whose optical resonance is located  in 750-900 nm spectral region were synthesized by combining Sn (tin)-surface  seeding and a shell growing process. The synthesized composite particles can be  potentially used in wide biological fields, due to biocompatibility and a  well-known bioconjugation technique of gold layer. Sn atoms, which can act not  only as a catalytic surface for reduction of gold but also as a linker between  silica surface and gold nanoparticles, were chemically deposited on hydroxylated  silica particles. Then, we introduced another reductant with gold chloride in  order to produce a multilayer of Au shell. In the process, Au shells grew by the  reduction of additional gold ions on the Sn-functionalized silica surface and  resulted in the subsequent coalescence and growth of the deposited gold  nanoparticles. Finally, a complete gold nanoshell was formed on the silica  surface by the one-step method, without a repeated coating process. The  deposition of a gold nanolayer on the silica particles was easily controlled by  the concentration ratio of Sn-functionalized silica particles and gold chloride  solutions. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images and optical extinction  spectra clearly showed that gold nanolayers were successfully deposited on the  silica surface by the novel method. As the gold colloids attached on the silica  surface grew, their optical plasmon peak became red-shifted until complete a gold  shell was formed. After the gold shell was completed, the optical plasmon  resonance became blue-shifted and the extinction spectra were functions of a  relative ratio of the core to shell thickness.

DT Review
AB From Weismann's theory to present day gerontology--Weismann's theory was based on  the concept that through natural selection the division potential of somatic  cells become finite thus limiting the regeneration of the soma and the life span  of the organism. Indeed, the somatic cells of some animals have a finite division  potential but what became apparent is that the implications for aging are more  complex. Experiments showed that at each cell division the genetic information  received by each daughter cell differs; cells are this way progressively modified  through division creating a functional drift that is responsible in part for the  continuous modifications going on in the organism from its very beginning to its  extinction. Comparative biology showed that the finite or the infinite division  potential of somatic cells has a complex connotation with developmental  characteristics of the respective organism with implications for longevity that  are far from being understood.

TI Slow late component in conditioned stimulus-evoked potentials from the amygdala
SO Neural plasticity
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB Male Wistar rats were subjected to a differential Pavlovian fear conditioning  procedure in which one of two tones (6 or 10 kHz) was followed by an electric  shock (CS+) and the other was not (CS-). Before and after fear conditioning, we  recorded the evoked potentials elicited by CS+ and CS- from electrodes aimed at  the lateral nucleus of the amygdala. Before conditioning, a slow, negative  component with peak amplitude around 150 ms was present in the evoked potentials.  This component was sensitive to habituation. After fear conditioning, both CS+  and CS- elicited the same late component, albeit with a larger amplitude. This  enhancement was temporary: decreasing amplitude was observed in the course of CS  test presentations under extinction. Prior research revealed a comparable slow  component in the amygdala of the cat under similar experimental conditions. The  collective results indicate that the large late component in the amygdala is  enhanced by fear conditioning, suggesting that such enhancement reflects the  anticipation of a biologically significant event.

TI Earth's biggest 'whodunnit': unravelling the clues in the case of the end-Permian
SO Philosophical transactions. Series A, Mathematical, physical, and engineering
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB The mass extinction that occurred at the end of the Permian period, 250 million  years ago, was the most devastating loss of life that Earth has ever experienced.  It is estimated that ca. 96% of marine species were wiped out and land plants,  reptiles, amphibians and insects also suffered. The causes of this catastrophic  event are currently a topic of intense debate. The geological record points to  significant environmental disturbances, for example, global warming and  stagnation of ocean water. A key issue is whether the Earth's feedback mechanisms  can become unstable on their own, or whether some forcing is required to  precipitate a catastrophe of this magnitude. A prime suspect for pushing Earth's  systems into a critical condition is massive end-Permian Siberian volcanism,  which would have pumped large quantities of carbon dioxide and toxic gases into  the atmosphere. Recently, it has been postulated that Earth was also the victim  of a bolide impact at this time. If further research substantiates this claim, it  raises some intriguing questions. The Cretaceous-Tertiary mass extinction, 65  million years ago, was contemporaneous with both an impact and massive volcanism.  Are both types of calamity necessary to drive Earth to the brink of faunal  cataclysm? We do not presently have enough pieces of the jigsaw to solve the  mystery of the end-Permian extinction, but the forensic work continues.

TI Parallel extinction risk and global distribution of languages and species.
SO Nature
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB There are global threats to biodiversity with current extinction rates well above  background levels. Although less well publicized, numerous human languages have  also become extinct, and others are threatened with extinction. However,  estimates of the number of threatened languages vary considerably owing to the  wide range of criteria used. For example, languages have been classified as  threatened if the number of speakers is less than 100, 500, 1,000, 10,000, 20,000  or 100,000 (ref. 3). Here I show, by applying internationally agreed criteria for  classifying species extinction risk, that languages are more threatened than  birds or mammals. Rare languages are more likely to show evidence of decline than  commoner ones. Areas with high language diversity also have high bird and mammal  diversity and all three show similar relationships to area, latitude, area of  forest and, for languages and birds, maximum altitude. The time of human  settlement has little effect on current language diversity. Although similar  factors explain the diversity of languages and biodiversity, the factors  explaining extinction risk for birds and mammals (high altitude, high human  densities and insularity) do not explain the numbers of endangered languages.

TI Analysis of a summertime PM2.5 and haze episode in the mid-Atlantic region.
SO Journal of the Air & Waste Management Association (1995)
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB Observations of the mass and chemical composition of particles less than 2.5  microm in aerodynamic diameter (PM2.5), light extinction, and meteorology in the  urban Baltimore-Washington corridor during July 1999 and July 2000 are presented  and analyzed to study summertime haze formation in the mid-Atlantic region. The  mass fraction of ammoniated sulfate (SO4(2-)) and carbonaceous material in PM2.5  were each approximately 50% for cleaner air (PM2.5< 10 microg/m3) but changed to  approximately 60% and approximately 20%, respectively, for more polluted air  (PM2.5>30 microg/m3). This signifies the role of SO4(2-) in haze formation.  Comparisons of data from this study with the Interagency Monitoring of Protected  Visual Environments network suggest that SO4(2-) is more regional than  carbonaceous material and originates in part from upwind source regions. The  light extinction coefficient is well correlated to PM2.5 mass plus water  associated with inorganic salt, leading to a mass extinction efficiency of 7.6  +/- 1.7 m2/g for hydrated aerosol. The most serious haze episode occurring  between July 15 and 19, 1999, was characterized by westerly transport and  recirculation slowing removal of pollutants. At the peak of this episode, 1-hr  PM2.5 concentration reached approximately 45 microg/m3, visual range dropped to  approximately 5 km, and aerosol water likely contributed to approximately 40% of  the light extinction coefficient.

TI Epidemiological modeling in a branching population. Particular case of a general
SO Mathematical biosciences
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB This paper covers the elaboration of a general class of multitype branching  processes for modeling in a branching population, the evolution of a disease with  horizontal and vertical transmissions. When the size of the population may tend  to infinity, normalization must be carried out. As the initial size tends to  infinity, the normalized model converges a.s. to a dynamical system the solution  of which is the probability law of the state of health for an individual  ancestors line. The focal point of this study concerns the transient and  asymptotical behaviors of a SIS model with two age classes in a branching  population. We will compare the asymptotical probability of extinction on the  scale of a finite population and on the scale of an individual in an infinite  population: when the rates of transmission are small compared to the rate of  renewing the population of susceptibles, the two models lead to a.s. extinction,  giving consistent results, which no longer applies to the opposite situation of  important transmissions. In that case the size of the population plays a crucial  role in the spreading of the disease.

DT Journal Article
AB The scalar optical properties (extinction coefficient, mass extinction  coefficient, single-scattering albedo, and asymmetry parameter) of a distribution  of randomly oriented ice aggregates are simulated generally to well within 4%  accuracy by use of a size-shape distribution of randomly oriented circular ice  cylinders at wavelengths in the terrestrial window region. The single-scattering  properties of the ice aggregates are calculated over the whole size distribution  function by the finite-difference time-domain and improved geometric optics  methods. The single-scattering properties of the size-shape distribution of  circular ice cylinders are calculated by the T-matrix method supplemented by  scattering solutions obtained from complex-angular-momentum theory. Moreover,  radiative-transfer studies demonstrate that the maximum error in brightness  temperature space when the size-shape distribution of circular ice cylinders is  used to represent scattering from ice aggregates is only approximately 0.4 K The  methodology presented should find wide applicability in remote sensing of ice  cloud and parameterization of cirrus cloud scalar optical properties in climate  models.

TI Predator diversity hotspots in the blue ocean.
SO Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB Concentrations of biodiversity, or hotspots, represent conservation priorities in  terrestrial ecosystems but remain largely unexplored in marine habitats. In the  open ocean, many large predators such as tunas, sharks, billfishes, and sea  turtles are of current conservation concern because of their vulnerability to  overfishing and ecosystem role. Here we use scientific-observer records from  pelagic longline fisheries in the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans to show that  oceanic predators concentrate in distinct diversity hotspots. Predator diversity  consistently peaks at intermediate latitudes (20-30 degrees N and S), where  tropical and temperate species ranges overlap. Individual hotspots are found  close to prominent habitat features such as reefs, shelf breaks, or seamounts and  often coincide with zooplankton and coral reef hotspots. Closed-area models in  the northwest Atlantic predict that protection of hotspots outperforms other area  closures in safeguarding threatened pelagic predators from ecological extinction.  We conclude that the seemingly monotonous landscape of the open ocean shows rich  structure in species diversity and that these features should be used to focus  future conservation efforts.

TI Catastrophic extinctions follow deforestation in Singapore.
SO Nature
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB The looming mass extinction of biodiversity in the humid tropics is a major  concern for the future, yet most reports of extinctions in these regions are  anecdotal or conjectural, with a scarcity of robust, broad-based empirical data.  Here we report on local extinctions among a wide range of terrestrial and  freshwater taxa from Singapore (540 km2) in relation to habitat loss exceeding  95% over 183 years. Substantial rates of documented and inferred extinctions were  found, especially for forest specialists, with the greatest proportion of extinct  taxa (34-87%) in butterflies, fish, birds and mammals. Observed extinctions were  generally fewer, but inferred losses often higher, in vascular plants, phasmids,  decapods, amphibians and reptiles (5-80%). Forest reserves comprising only 0.25%  of Singapore's area now harbour over 50% of the residual native biodiversity.  Extrapolations of the observed and inferred local extinction data, using a  calibrated species-area model, imply that the current unprecedented rate of  habitat destruction in Southeast Asia will result in the loss of 13-42% of  regional populations over the next century, at least half of which will represent  global species extinctions.

TI Time and space issues in ecotoxicology: population models, landscape pattern
SO Environmental toxicology and chemistry
LA English
DT Review
AB Advances in ecotoxicology addressing problems of time and spatial scales are  presented and interpreted in the frame of concepts on population/community  dynamics and landscape pattern analysis. Example deterministic/probabilistic  modeling experiments are used to illustrate key concepts. Space and time scales  analyzed are single and multigenerations of local populations, metapopulations,  community, and ecosystem/landscape. Most population models used in recent  ecotoxicology studies are deterministic and do not include a formal treatment of  spatial processes, like migration or local random extinction. Some metapopulation  models have been applied with success. Upscaling of ecotoxicological results at  the community level is less developed, probably because of the inherent  complexity of indirect and direct coactions among organisms. Community and  ecosystem toxicity end points that could find a broad use in regulatory  applications have not yet been identified. Some practical issues like the  estimation of the potential for the natural attenuation of toxicity and the  transport of contaminants along food chains must be addressed at these  scales/levels of biological complexity. The estimation of ecotoxicological  effects has been increasingly evolving to integrate modeling and monitoring  contaminant transport and fate, landscape pattern analysis, and spatially  explicit population dynamics (including direct and indirect communal  interactions).

TI Phylogeny of Acridocarpus-Brachylophon (Malpighiaceae): implications for tertiary
SO Evolution; international journal of organic evolution
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB A major tenet of African Tertiary biogeography posits that lowland rainforest  dominated much of Africa in the late Cretaceous and was replaced by xeric  vegetation as a response to continental uplift and consequent widespread  aridification beginning in the late Paleogene. The aridification of Africa is  thought to have been a major factor in the extinction of many African  humid-tropical lineages, and in the present-day disparity of species diversity  between Africa and other tropical regions. This primarily geologically based  model can be tested with independent phylogenetic evidence from widespread  African plant groups containing both humid- and xeric-adapted species. We  estimated the phylogeny and lineage divergence times within one such angiosperm  group, the acridocarpoid clade (Malpighiaceae), with combined ITS, ndhF, and  trnL-F data from 15 species that encompass the range of morphological and  geographic variation within the group. Dispersal-vicariance analysis and  divergence-time estimates suggest that the basal acridocarpoid divergence  occurred between African and Southeast Asian lineages approximately 50 million  years ago (mya), perhaps after a southward ancestral retreat from high-latitude  tropical forests in response to intermittent Eocene cooling. Dispersion of  Aeridocarpus from Africa to Madagascar is inferred between approximately 50 and  35 mya, when lowland humid tropical forest was nearly continuous between these  landmasses. A single dispersal event within Acridocarpus is inferred from western  Africa to eastern Africa between approximately 23 and 17 mya, coincident with the  widespread replacement of humid forests by savannas in eastern Africa. Although  the spread of xeric environments resulted in the extinction of many African plant  groups, our data suggest that for others it provided an opportunity for further  diversification.

The two most-discussed candidates for a general extinction mechanism are impacts  and flood-basalt eruptions. A compilation of evidence for impact at the times of  mass extinctions shows that this cause is abundantly confirmed in the case of the  Cretaceous-Tertiary extinction and the late Eocene, which is a time of minor and  gradual extinction, but little or no evidence connects other major extinctions to  impact. On the other hand, there is a remarkable time correlation between flood  basalts and four major extinctions, but no other evidence that flood basalts  cause mass extinctions. The evidence for an impact-extinction linkage is  strikingly different from that for a connection between flood basalts and  extinctions. Flood basalts cover larger areas than craters and their associated  thick ejecta blankets, which are thus less likely to be found. Impacts distribute  proxies globally at instantaneous time horizons, whereas flood-basalt events are  extended in time, and no remote proxies have been recognized. Many global killing  mechanisms have been proposed in the case of impacts, but few have been suggested  for flood basalts. It is possible that flood basalts are triggered by impact, but  it is not obvious how impacts could result from anything other than chance. The  hypothesis that impacts are the general cause of mass extinctions has not  received supporting evidence, but has not been falsified. The hypothesis that  flood basalts are the general cause of mass extinctions is supported by evidence  from timing, but is not susceptible to falsification. Other candidates for  general extinction causes, especially sea-level changes and system instabilities,  would require separate treatment. The question is still very much open.

TI Random walks in the history of life.

DT Journal Article
AB The simplest null hypothesis for evolutionary time series is that the observed  data follow a random walk. We examined whether aspects of Sepkoski's compilation  of marine generic diversity depart from a random walk by using statistical tests  from econometrics. Throughout most of the Phanerozoic, the random-walk null  hypothesis is not rejected for marine diversity, accumulated origination or  accumulated extinction, suggesting that either these variables were correlated  with environmental variables that follow a random walk or so many mechanisms were  affecting these variables, in different ways, that the resultant trends appear  random. The only deviation from this pattern involves rejection of the null  hypothesis for roughly the last 75 million years for the diversity and  accumulated origination time series.

TI Climate change and habitat destruction: a deadly anthropogenic cocktail.
SO Proceedings. Biological sciences
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB Climate change and habitat destruction are two of the greatest threats to global  biodiversity. Lattice models have been used to investigate how hypothetical  species with different characteristics respond to habitat loss. The main result  shows that a sharp threshold in habitat availability exists below which a species  rapidly becomes extinct. Here, a similar modelling approach is taken to establish  what determines how species respond to climate change. A similar threshold exists  for the rate of climate change as has been observed for habitat loss-patch  occupancy remains high up to a critical rate of climate change, beyond which  species extinction becomes likely. Habitat specialists, especially those of  relatively poor colonizing ability are least able to keep pace with climate  change. The interaction between climate change and habitat loss might be  disastrous. During climate change, the habitat threshold occurs sooner.  Similarly, species suffer more from climate change in a fragmented habitat.

TI Local extinction and the evolution of dispersal rates: causes and correlations.
SO The American naturalist
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB We present the results of individual-based simulation experiments on the  evolution of dispersal rates of organisms living in metapopulations. We find  conflicting results regarding the relationship between local extinction rate and  evolutionarily stable (ES) dispersal rate depending on which principal mechanism  causes extinction: if extinction is caused by environmental catastrophes  eradicating local populations, we observe a positive correlation between  extinction and ES dispersal rate; if extinction is a consequence of stochastic  local dynamics and environmental fluctuations, the correlation becomes ambiguous;  and in cases where extinction is caused by dispersal mortality, a negative  correlation between local extinction rate and ES dispersal rate emerges. We  conclude that extinction rate, which both affects and is affected by dispersal  rates, is not an ideal predictor for optimal dispersal rates.

AB The extinction of the dodo (Raphus cucullatus L.; Fig. 1) is commonly dated to  the last confirmed sighting in 1662, reported by Volkert Evertsz on an islet off  Mauritius. By this time, the dodo had become extremely rare - the previous  sighting having been 24 years earlier - but the species probably persisted unseen  beyond this date. Here we use a statistical method to establish the actual  extinction time of the dodo as 1690, almost 30 years after its most recent  sighting.

TI Predicting which species will benefit from corridors in fragmented landscapes
SO The American naturalist
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB Connecting isolated patches of habitat in fragmented landscapes with corridors is  a popular conservation strategy. This strategy is also controversial in large  part because of uncertainty about what characteristics of a species and its  environment promote corridor use. In this article we address the question, For  what types of species will populations benefit from corridors? We asked this  question using a model of two logistically growing populations connected by  migration in which both emigration and migration success were determined by the  presence or absence of a corridor. We found that in the short run (e.g., during  recovery from disaster), corridors are most effective for species with  fast-growing populations that have low survivorship when dispersing through  unsuitable (matrix) habitat. We also found that emigration rates and  habitat-specific mortality rates are key determinants of the effects of corridors  on population size. In the long term, corridors are most likely to benefit  species with slow-growing populations that have low survivorship when dispersing  through matrix habitat. Our results confirm the major conclusions from previous  empirical studies of corridor benefits. However, most studies fail to consider  the most appropriate questions to determine the potential benefits of habitat  corridors. First, what is the time scale of the conservation goal? Corridors have  positive effects on different suites of species in the short and long term.  Second, is the major threat of local extinction due to sustained population  decline or boom-bust cycles? Third, what is the migration rate through the  matrix? Fourth, what fraction of migrants dispersing through the matrix  successfully immigrate to another patch?

AB Cohorts of marine taxa that originated during recoveries from mass extinctions  were commonly more widespread spatially than those originating at other times.  Coupled with the recognition of a correlation between the geographic ranges and  temporal longevities of marine taxa, this observation predicts that recovery taxa  were unusually long-lived geologically. We analyzed this possibility by assessing  the longevities of marine genus cohorts that originated in successive substages  throughout the Phanerozoic. Results confirm that several mass extinction recovery  cohorts were significantly longer lived than other cohorts, but this effect was  limited to the post-Paleozoic, suggesting differences in the dynamics of  Paleozoic versus post-Paleozoic diversification.

Several  algorithms that use between two and five recorded frames allow us to optimize  measurements for speed, sensitivity, and accuracy. We show images of asters,  which consist of radial arrays of microtubule polymers recorded with a polarized  light microscope equipped with a universal compensator. Our experimental results  confirm our theoretical expectations. The lowest noise level of 0.036 nm was  obtained when we used the five-frame technique and four-frame algorithm without  extinction setting. The two-frame technique allows us to increase the speed of  measurement with acceptable image quality.

TI Historical contingency in the evolution of primate color vision.
SO Journal of human evolution
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB Primates are unique among eutherian mammals for possessing three types of retinal  cone. Curiously, catarrhines, platyrrhines, and strepsirhines share this anatomy  to different extents, and no hypothesis has hitherto accounted for this  variability. Here we propose that the historical biogeography of figs and  arborescent palms accounts for the global variation in primate color vision.  Specifically, we suggest that primates invaded Paleogene forests characterized by  figs and palms, the fruits of which played a keystone function. Primates not only  relied on such resources, but also provided high-quality seed dispersal. In turn,  figs and palms lost or simply did not evolve conspicuous coloration, as this  conferred little advantage for attracting mammals. We suggest that the abundance  and coloration of figs and palms offered a selective advantage to foraging groups  with mixed capabilities for chromatic distinction. Climatic cooling at the end of  the Eocene and into the Neogene resulted in widespread regional extinction or  decimation of palms and (probably) figs. In regions where figs and palms became  scarce, we suggest primates evolved routine trichromatic vision in order to  exploit proteinaceous young leaves as a replacement resource. A survey of the hue  and biogeography of extant figs and palms provides some empirical support. Where  these resources are infrequent, primates are routinely trichromatic and consume  young leaves during seasonal periods of fruit dearth. These results imply a link  between the differential evolution of primate color vision and climatic changes  during the Eocene-Oligocene transition.

DT Journal Article
AB Theoretical and experimental evidences of extinction and coexistence during batch  interaction of killer and sensitive strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae grown as  a mixed culture in pure water are provided. The experimental results show that in  the limited nutrient conditions of growth in pure water, the killer yeast is  subject to extinction when the initial concentration ratio of killer to sensitive  yeast is 1:100. However, if the initial concentration ratio of killer to  sensitive yeast is 1:1, both strains coexist. Substantial damped oscillations are  associated with the growth process in the mixed culture. A new theoretical model  that was originally developed for recovering the growth of single species in  isolation is extended and applied to two species competing over a common  ecological niche. The solutions of the model are shown to recover all the  qualitative features captured in the experiments.

TI Establishment success and extinction risk in autocorrelated environments.
SO Theoretical population biology
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB We consider establishment success (and extinction risk of small populations) in  fluctuating environments, by means of an inhomogeneous branching process model.  In this model it is assumed that individuals reproduce asexually during discrete  reproduction periods. Within each period individuals reproduce independently and  have random numbers of offspring. Expected numbers of offspring vary over  reproduction periods due to random environmental changes. Previous simulation  results indicated that there is a positive autocorrelation between the  establishment probabilities of invaders in successive reproduction periods when  environmental states are independently distributed. This result was never  formally proved. In this paper we prove that this is indeed true, regardless of  the form of the distribution of environmental states or the offspring  distribution (under a monotonicity condition, which holds for biologically  realistic models). Furthermore, we prove that it is also true for positively  autocorrelated environmental states. We show by a counterexample that in  environments with a strong negative autocorrelation establishment probabilities  can be negatively autocorrelated. This was further examined through simulations.  Our results imply that in independent, positively autocorrelated and weakly  negatively autocorrelated environments the probability of success of invasion in  different independently varying sites is the highest, followed by sequential  invasion. For environments with a strong negative autocorrelation, sequential  invasion has the highest probability of success. Effects of autocorrelation were  further examined with simulations. From the results it appears that the expected  length of 'runs of bad luck' is the most crucial factor for establishment  success.

TI Is cladogenesis heritable?
SO Systematic biology
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB The heritability of speciation rates and extinction risks is a crucial parameter  in models of macroevolution, but little direct evidence has been available to  assess the occurrence, strength, or generality of this heritability. We tested  for heritability using correlations between ancestral and descendent branch  lengths in phylogenetic trees, an approach first applied to a bird phylogeny by  Harvey et al. (1991, pages 123-137 in Genes in ecology [R. J. Berry et al.,  eds.], Blackwell Scientific, Oxford). We applied Harvey et al.'s test to some of  the largest DNA sequence-based phylogenetic analyses published to date for  plants, insects, fungi, and bacteria. If one of two parent lineages splits first  and if this is the case for any heritable reason, then on average we expect its  daughter lineages to also split first. We also used a randomization procedure to  assess significance of branch length heritability. Using maximum parsimony and  maximum likelihood branch lengths and trees made ultrametric after nonparametric  rate smoothing or by enforcing a molecular clock, we found a pattern for most  clades consistent with heritable net cladogenesis. Heritability of cladogenesis  may be a general phenomenon, detectable across a large number of lineages and a  broad range of taxa.

TI Mollusc-microbe mutualisms extend the potential for life in hypersaline systems.
SO Astrobiology
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB Metazoans in extreme environments have evolved mutualisms with microbes that  extend the physical and chemical capabilities of both partners. Some of the best  examples are bivalve molluscs in evaporite and hypersaline settings. Mollusc  tissue is developmentally and evolutionarily amenable to housing vast numbers of  symbiotic microbes. Documented benefits to the host are nutritional. Multiple  postulated benefits to the microbes are related to optimizing metabolic  performance at interfaces, where heterogeneity and steep gradients that cannot be  negotiated by microbes can be spanned by larger metazoan hosts. A small cockle,  Fragum erugatum, and its photosymbiotic microbes provide a remarkable example of  a mutualistic partnership in the hypersaline reaches of Shark Bay, Western  Australia. Lucinid bivalves and their endosymbiotic chemolithotrophic bacteria  provide examples in which hosts span oxic/anoxic interfaces on behalf of their  symbionts at sites of seafloor venting. Multiple lines of evidence underscore the  antiquity of mutualisms and suggest that they may have played a significant role  in life's first experiments above the prokaryotic grade of complexity. The study  of metazoan-microbe mutualisms and their signatures in extreme environments in  the geologic record will provide a significant augmentation to microbial models  in paleobiology and astrobiology. There are strong potential links between  mutualisms and the early history of life on Earth, the persistence of life in  extreme environments at times of global crisis and mass extinction, and the  possibilities for life elsewhere in the universe.

AB Ecological studies suggest that rare taxa are more likely to go extinct than  abundant ones, but the influence of abundance on survivorship in the fossil  record has received little attention. An analysis of Late Maastrichtian bivalve  subgenera from the North American Coastal Plain found no evidence that  survivorship is tied to abundance across the end-Cretaceous mass extinction (65  million years ago), regardless of abundance metric or spatial scale examined. The  fact that abundance does not promote survivorship in end-Cretaceous bivalves  suggests that the factors influencing survivorship during mass extinctions in the  fossil record may differ from those operating during intervals of background  extinction.

TI Inbreeding depression in fecundity and inbred line extinction in the bulb mite,
SO Heredity
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB This study investigated the magnitude of inbreeding depression in fecundity, and  whether the depression is purged during six generations of sib mating in the bulb  mite, Rhizoglyphus robini. The progeny resulting from a single generation of  brother-sister mating suffered significant inbreeding depression in fecundity.  During the following six generations of continuous sib-mating, 58% lines were  lost, 45% because of sterility and 13% because of preadult mortality. The lines  were then outcrossed, and their inbreeding depression compared with that of the  base population. The inbreeding depression for the outcrossed population was  0.15, and for the base population 0.19, but the difference was not significant.  The lack of significant purging of inbreeding depression indicates that it was  caused either by detrimental genes of small effect, or by the breaking down of  overdominant relations between alleles. However, the large proportion of extinct  lines points to the former mechanism as a predominant cause of inbreeding  depression. Theory predicts that the probability of line extinction with  inbreeding increases with its load of mutations. If phenotypic variation in  fecundity was partly because of differences in numbers of mutations carried by  individuals, the fecundity of the line founder could be expected to correlate  with the probability that the line derived from it will survive long-term  inbreeding. Indeed, fecundity of founder females was significantly associated  with line survival, which suggests that line extinction rate may be used as a  method to study individual mutational loads, for example, in studies of sexual  selection.

TI Behavioral plasticity and virus propagation: the FIV-cat population example.
SO Theoretical population biology
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB A new theoretical approach is proposed to investigate the effect of  intra-individual variability in behavior on the spread of directly transmitted  diseases within host populations. The classical hawk-dove game is used to  describe interactions between individuals on a fast time scale (the day).  Individuals may exhibit both tactics according to their own experience, to  environment conditions, and to the opponent. They are not able to recognize the  epidemiological state of their opponents. This fast-time part of the model is  coupled to a classical compartmental epidemic model describing the demography of  the population and the transmission of the disease from an infected individual to  a healthy one on a slow time scale (the year). The model is applied to the case  of feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV)-domestic cat population system. Our model  gives rise to different predictions according to values of cost and gain due to  fights: extinction of the epidemic, FIV endemicity at low, intermediate and high  prevalence. These predictions are in good agreement with results from domestic  cat populations living in different environmental conditions.

SO Transactions of the Royal Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene

DT Journal Article
AB Individual-based models provide powerful tools to model complex interactions  characterized by individual variability. This paper presents an object-oriented  design for individual-based modelling of Plasmodium falciparum malaria  transmission. Two kinds of objects, human and mosquito, that exhibit variability  among individuals for parameters such as recovery and survival rates are defined.  The model tracks the dynamics of human hosts and adult female mosquitoes  individually. Immunity, modelled as a function of exposure history, is  represented by reduced susceptibility and increased recovery rate. The model was  calibrated using epidemiological data collected at 30 sites along the coast of  Kenya. The sites were grouped into low, intermediate and high transmission based  on mean daily human-biting rates. Simulation results show that malaria  transmission was stable even in low transmission areas where the human-biting  rate is approximately 0.5 bite per day. The model was used to examine the effect  of infection control programmes that aim at interrupting transmission by reducing  human-vector contact rates and implementing active case detection and drug  treatment of infections. With this intervention, local elimination of malaria is  likely with a probability of extinction of approximately 0.8 in low transmission  areas. However, a small amount of immigration (> 0.3%) by infected people into  the community could prevent local extinction of the parasite. In intermediate and  high transmission areas, reduction in prevalence is short-lived and the  probability of local elimination is low, even at high coverage levels of the  intervention.

TI Quantification of tamoxifen DNA adducts using on-line sample preparation and
SO Chemical research in toxicology
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB The nonsteroidal antiestrogen tamoxifen is used as an adjuvant chemotherapeutic  agent for the treatment of all stages of hormone-dependent breast cancer and more  recently as a chemopreventive agent in women with elevated risk of developing the  disease. While clearly beneficial for the treatment of breast cancer, tamoxifen  has been reported to increase the risk of endometrial cancer in women.  Furthermore, it has been shown to be hepatocarcinogenic in rats. Tamoxifen is  clearly genotoxic in rat liver, as indicated by the formation of DNA adducts; the  occurrence of tamoxifen DNA adducts in human endometrial tissue is more  controversial. The detection and quantitation of tamoxifen DNA adducts have  relied primarily upon (32)P-postlabeling, with other techniques, such as  immunoassays and accelerator mass spectrometry, being used to a much lesser  extent. To expand the range of available analytical methodologies for quantifying  tamoxifen DNA adducts, we have developed an assay using on-line sample  preparation, coupled with HPLC and electrospray ionization tandem mass  spectrometry (ES-MS/MS). alpha-Acetoxytamoxifen was reacted with salmon testis  DNA at ratios between 0.1 ng and 1 mg alpha-acetoxytamoxifen per mg DNA. After  enzymatic hydrolysis to nucleosides, the most highly modified DNA samples were  analyzed by HPLC-UV, which indicated the presence of two adduct peaks in  approximately a 1:4 ratio. The major adduct was isolated, rigorously  characterized as (E)-alpha-(deoxyguanosin-N(2)-yl)tamoxifen, and quantified on  the basis of its molar extinction coefficient. A similar reaction was conducted  with [N(CD(3))(2)]-alpha-acetoxytamoxifen to prepare a deuterated adduct that  could serve as an internal standard for ES-MS/MS. The limit of detection for the  HPLC-ES-MS/MS method was approximately 5 adducts/10(9) nucleotides, with an  intra- and interassay precision of 3% relative standard deviation. The method was  validated over the range of 8-1 520,000 adducts/10(8) nucleotides using 100  microg samples of DNA modified in vitro. Analysis of liver DNA from female  Sprague-Dawley rats treated by gavage with seven daily doses of 20 mg  tamoxifen/kg body weight gave a value of 496 +/- 16 adducts/10(8) nucleotides for  (E)-alpha-(deoxyguanosin-N(2)-yl)tamoxifen and 626 +/- 18 adducts/10(8)  nucleotides for (E)-alpha-(deoxyguanosin-N(2)-yl)-N-desmethyltamoxifen. These  data indicate that the HPLC-ES-MS/MS methodology has sufficient sensitivity and  precision to be useful in the analysis of tamoxifen DNA adducts formed in vivo in  experimental models and may be able to detect tamoxifen DNA adduct formation in  human tissue samples.

DT Review
AB RNA virus populations consist of complex and dynamic mutant distributions, rather  than defined genomic sequences. This feature confers great adaptability on  viruses and is partly responsible for current difficulties of viral disease  prevention and control. Mutant distributions, also termed mutant swarms or mutant  clouds, were first proposed in a theory of molecular evolution termed  quasispecies theory. The theoretical formulation of quasispecies and its links to  present day RNA viruses are discussed. The need to accommodate antiviral  strategies to the dynamic nature of viral populations is emphasized. In  particular, recent results on viral extinction associated with enhanced  mutagenesis (virus entry into error catastrophe) are reviewed and presented as an  example of how the understanding of viruses as quasispecies could lead to a  potential practical application in medicine.

TI Extinction and re-evolution of similar adaptive types (ecomorphs) in Cenozoic
SO Die Naturwissenschaften
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB Numerous patterns in periodicity (e.g., climate, extinction, and sedimentary  cycles) and evolutionary change (e.g., chronofaunas and coordinated stasis) have  been described based on aspects of the geologic record. Recently, convergent  occurrences of faunal types or "repeating faunas" have received attention, but a  highly specific, iterative pattern was first reported over 40 years ago. In the  late 1950s, van der Hammen described climatic/floral cycles on the order of six  million years based on a succession of A, B, and C pollen community types in  South America. These A-B-C cycles are also seen in the replacement pattern of  particular carnivore and ungulate adaptive types in Cenozoic North America as  reported by Martin in the 1980s. For example, in the last 36 million years, there  were four iterations of a sabertooth cat ecomorph independently evolving,  dominating the niche through an A-B-C cycle, and then going extinct. Here we show  further support for the existence of these cycles in the dominance turnover in  hippo and dog ecomorphs in the North American Cenozoic. Shared patterns of  extinction and re-evolution of adaptive types among plants and mammals across two  continents suggest a global mechanism, which appears to be climatic change.  Iterative climatic cycles of various scales may form a predictive framework for  understanding fundamental patterns in the geologic record, such as radiations,  extinction, rates of change, convergence, and sedimentary cycles.

SO Pharmaceutical research
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB PURPOSE: This study compares the use of UV-VIS detection with liquid  chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC/MS) detection for the PAMPA (Parallel  Artificial Membrane Permeability Assay) permeability determination of compounds  in the drug discovery stage. LC/MS detection offers a selective and sensitive  method for the determination of the PAMPA permeability for compounds that do not  contain a UV chromophore or possess a low UV extinction coefficient. To enhance  the reliability of our permeability measurements for compounds with low aqueous  solubility, we demonstrated the use of LC/MS detection as a means for  facilitating the study of solubilizing agents to enhance aqueous solubility that  normally would interfere with UV-VIS detection. In doing so, the PAMPA assay can  be expanded to study the in vitro permeability of poorly water soluble compounds  and evaluate the effects of solubilizers' on the membrane permeability of  different compounds. This might be useful in selecting solubilizers for poorly  water soluble compounds to be used for further in vivo studies. METHODS: A  diverse set of 20 drugs using UV-VIS detection were compared with data using  LC/MS detection. A PAMPA screening method was designed which used solubilizers  (Brij 35, Cremophor EL, ethanol, and Tween 80) for compounds with low aqueous  solubility. The stability of the artificial membrane was determined using various  solubilizer concentrations (0.1-5% w/v) to ensure the phospholipid membrane was  not disrupted. Two compounds, amiodarone and miconazole, with low aqueous  solubility yielding an undetected response in the PAMPA assay using UV-VIS  detection were subjected to the different solubilizing agents and their PAMPA  permeability was measured using LC/MS detection. RESULTS: Most of the compounds  showed similar PAMPA permeability using the two detection systems. However, for  compounds lacking a UV chromophore or with a low UV extinction coefficient, LC/MS  was the detection method of choice for determination of PAMPA permeability  values. LC/MS also gave reliable quantification data for compounds containing  impurities, as well as compounds that were not stable during the assay. Although  many solubilizers were found to interfere with UV-VIS detection, the LC/MS  approach was applicable to determine the permeability values of compounds with  normally low aqueous solubility. CONCLUSIONS: LC/MS detection offered greater  sensitivity and selectivity as compared with UV-VIS detection for the PAMPA  assay. With this added versatility in detection, PAMPA can be used in both  discovery and pre-formulation applications, which has not been described before.

TI Neutral theory and relative species abundance in ecology.
SO Nature
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB The theory of island biogeography asserts that an island or a local community  approaches an equilibrium species richness as a result of the interplay between  the immigration of species from the much larger metacommunity source area and  local extinction of species on the island (local community). Hubbell generalized  this neutral theory to explore the expected steady-state distribution of relative  species abundance (RSA) in the local community under restricted immigration. Here  we present a theoretical framework for the unified neutral theory of biodiversity  and an analytical solution for the distribution of the RSA both in the  metacommunity (Fisher's log series) and in the local community, where there are  fewer rare species. Rare species are more extinction-prone, and once they go  locally extinct, they take longer to re-immigrate than do common species.  Contrary to recent assertions, we show that the analytical solution provides a  better fit, with fewer free parameters, to the RSA distribution of tree species  on Barro Colorado Island, Panama, than the lognormal distribution.

TI Familial versus mass selection in small populations.
SO Genetics, selection, evolution : GSE
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB We used diffusion approximations and a Markov-chain approach to investigate the  consequences of familial selection on the viability of small populations both in  the short and in the long term. The outcome of familial selection was compared to  the case of a random mating population under mass selection. In small  populations, the higher effective size, associated with familial selection,  resulted in higher fitness for slightly deleterious and/or highly recessive  alleles. Conversely, because familial selection leads to a lower rate of  directional selection, a lower fitness was observed for more detrimental genes  that are not highly recessive, and with high population sizes. However, in the  long term, genetic load was almost identical for both mass and familial selection  for populations of up to 200 individuals. In terms of mean time to extinction,  familial selection did not have any negative effect at least for small  populations (N< or =50). Overall, familial selection could be proposed for use in  management programs of small populations since it increases genetic variability  and short-term viability without impairing the overall persistence times.

TI Global diversification rates of passerine birds.
SO Proceedings. Biological sciences
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB The distribution of species richness in families of passerine birds suggests that  the net rate of diversification was significantly higher than average in as many  as 7 out of 47 families. However, the absence of excess species richness among  the 106 tribes within these families indicates that these high rates were  transient, perhaps associated in some cases with tectonic movements or dispersal  events that extended geographical ranges. Thus, large clade size among passerine  birds need not represent intrinsic key innovations that influence the rate of  diversification. Approximately 17 families and 30 tribes have too few species  relative to other passerine taxa. Many of these are ecologically or  geographically marginal, being especially overrepresented in the Australasian  region. Observed intervals between lineage splitting suggest that extinction has  occurred ca. 90% as frequently as speciation (waiting times of 1.03 and 0.93 Myr)  and that the 47 modern families comprising 5712 species descended from  approximately 430 passerine lineages extant 24 Myr ago. Speciation and extinction  rates among small, marginal families might be 1-2 orders of magnitude lower.

AB We review recent developments in spatially realistic metapopulation theory, which  leads to quantitative models of the dynamics of species inhabiting highly  fragmented landscapes. Our emphasis is in stochastic patch occupancy models,  which describe the presence or absence of the focal species in habitat patches.  We discuss a number of ecologically important quantities that can be derived from  the full stochastic models and their deterministic approximations, with a  particular aim of characterizing the respective roles of the structure of the  landscape and the properties of the species. These quantities include the  threshold condition for persistence, the contributions that individual habitat  patches make to metapopulation dynamics and persistence, the time to  metapopulation extinction, and the effective size of a metapopulation living in a  heterogeneous patch network.

TI The evolution of placental mammal body sizes: evolutionary history, form, and
SO Oecologia
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB The unimodal, right-skewed distribution, most frequently identified in  contemporary descriptions of placental mammal body size distributions, masks an  underlying multidistribution structure; a long-term evolutionary process that has  generated a concatenation of two or three frequency distributions specific to  locomotory modes (plantigrade, digitigrade and unguligrade). The Afrotropical  assemblages are bimodal, with a tendency towards trimodality, whereas the  Nearctic assemblage is unimodal. However, mixtures of two and three normal  distributions fitted the Nearctic data well, suggesting a multidistribution  structure masked by disproportionate species numbers within locomotory modes.  Differences in proportional species numbers within modes between assemblages may  reflect the evolutionary history of form and function. However, common  interassemblage predictions of such proportions in contemporary distributions may  be disguised by the relative severity of the Pleistocene megafaunal extinction  (patterns supported by the fossil record), geographical scale, and taxonomic  composition. A species gap occurs at body sizes around 1 kg at the interface  between the largest plantigrade mammals and the smallest digitigrade mammals,  coincident with the minimum interspecific variance of basal metabolic rate. In  terms of the evolution of the optimal body size in the trade-off between  mortality and production, there may be good historical and evolutionary reasons  why we should not expect optimization to produce the same results in different  zoogeographical assemblages. Moreover, the evolution of diverse mammalian forms  and functions, especially with respect to predator-prey interactions and diet,  render a single body size optimum untenable in the search for an energetic  definition of fitness.

TI Gene flow and the coevolution of parasite range.
SO Evolution; international journal of organic evolution
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB The geographic range of many parasites is restricted relative to that of their  hosts. We study possible evolutionary mechanisms for this observation using a  simple model that couples coevolution and demography. The model assumes that the  environment consists of two habitats connected by movement and that coevolution  is governed by quantitative traits. Our results demonstrate that host gene flow  is an important determinant of parasite geographic range. Fluctuations in the  rate of host gene flow cause shifts in parasite population densities and  associated range expansions or contractions. In extreme cases, changing the rate  of host gene flow can lead to global extinction of the parasite. Through a  process we term demographic compensation, these shifts in parasite density may  occur with little or no change in parasite adaptation to the host. As a  consequence, reciprocal adaptation between host and parasite can become uncoupled  from the rate of host gene flow.

SO Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB Terrestrial climates near the time of the end-Cretaceous mass extinction are  poorly known, limiting understanding of environmentally driven changes in  biodiversity that occurred before bolide impact. We estimate paleotemperatures  for the last approximately 1.1 million years of the Cretaceous ( approximately  66.6-65.5 million years ago, Ma) by using fossil plants from North Dakota and  employ paleomagnetic stratigraphy to correlate the results to foraminiferal  paleoclimatic data from four middle- and high-latitude sites. Both plants and  foraminifera indicate warming near 66.0 Ma, a warming peak from approximately  65.8 to 65.6 Ma, and cooling near 65.6 Ma, suggesting that these were global  climate shifts. The warming peak coincides with the immigration of a thermophilic  flora, maximum plant diversity, and the poleward range expansion of thermophilic  foraminifera. Plant data indicate the continuation of relatively cool  temperatures across the Cretaceous-Paleogene boundary; there is no indication of  a major warming immediately after the boundary as previously reported. Our  temperature proxies correspond well with recent pCO(2) data from paleosol  carbonate, suggesting a coupling of pCO(2) and temperature. To the extent that  biodiversity is correlated with temperature, estimates of the severity of  end-Cretaceous extinctions that are based on occurrence data from the warming  peak are probably inflated, as we illustrate for North Dakota plants. However,  our analysis of climate and facies considerations shows that the effects of  bolide impact should be regarded as the most significant contributor to these  plant extinctions.

Of nearly 1,000 species  worldwide, 239 are considered threatened by the International Union for  Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN) and 12 are extinct. Small  geographic ranges and low wing aspect ratios are independently found to predict  extinction risk in bats, which explains 48% of the total variance in IUCN  assessments of threat. The pattern and correlates of extinction risk in the two  bat suborders are significantly different. A higher proportion (4%) of  megachiropteran species have gone extinct in the last 500 years than  microchiropteran bats (0.3%), and a higher proportion is currently at risk of  extinction (Megachiroptera: 34%; Microchiroptera: 22%). While correlates of  microchiropteran extinction risk are the same as in the order as a whole,  megachiropteran extinction is correlated more with reproductive rate and less  with wing morphology. Bat extinction risk is not randomly distributed  phylogenetically: closely related species have more similar levels of threat than  would be expected if extinction risk were random. Given the unbalanced nature of  the evolutionary diversification of bats, it is probable that the amount of  phylogenetic diversity lost if currently threatened taxa disappear may be greater  than in other clades with numerically more threatened species.

TI Extreme reversed sexual size dimorphism in the extinct New Zealand moa Dinornis.
SO Nature
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB The ratite moa (Aves; Dinornithiformes) were massive graviportal browsers  weighing up to 250 kg (ref. 1) that dominated the New Zealand biota until their  extinction approximately 500 yr ago. Despite an extensive Quaternary fossil  record, moa taxonomy remains problematic and currently 11 species are recognized.  Three Dinornis species were found throughout New Zealand and differed markedly in  size (1-2 m height at back) and mass (from approximately 34 to 242 kg).  Surprisingly, ancient mitochondrial DNA sequences show that the three species  were genetically indistinguishable within each island, but formed separate North  and South Island clades. Here we show, using the first sex-linked nuclear  sequences from an extinct species, that on each island the three morphological  forms actually represent just one species, whose size varied markedly according  to sex and habitat. The largest females in this example of extreme reversed  sexual size dimorphism were about 280% the weight and 150% the height of the  largest males, which is unprecedented among birds and terrestrial mammals. The  combination of molecular and palaeontological data highlights the difficulties of  analysing extinct groups, even those with detailed fossil records.

TI Geographic range size, life history and rates of diversification in Australian
SO Journal of evolutionary biology
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB What causes species richness to vary among different groups of organisms? Two  hypotheses are that large geographical ranges and fast life history either reduce  extinction rates or raise speciation rates, elevating a clade's rate of  diversification. Here we present a comparative analysis of these hypotheses using  data on the phylogenetic relationships, geographical ranges and life history of  the terrestrial mammal fauna of Australia. By comparing species richness patterns  to null models, we show that species are distributed nonrandomly among genera.  Using sister-clade comparisons to control for clade age, we then find that faster  diversification is significantly associated with larger geographical ranges and  larger litters, but there is no evidence for an effect of body size or age at  first breeding on diversification rates. We believe the most likely explanation  for these patterns is that larger litters and geographical ranges increase  diversification rates because they buffer species from extinction. We also  discuss the possibility that positive effects of litter size and range size on  diversification rates result from elevated speciation rates.

TI Impact ejecta layer from the mid-Devonian: possible connection to global mass
SO Science (New York, N.Y.)

DT Journal Article
AB We have found evidence for a bolide impacting Earth in the mid-Devonian (  approximately 380 million years ago), including high concentrations of shocked  quartz, Ni, Cr, As, V, and Co anomalies; a large negative carbon isotope shift  (-9 per mil); and microspherules and microcrysts at Jebel Mech Irdane in the Anti  Atlas desert near Rissani, Morocco. This impact is important because it is  coincident with a major global extinction event (Kacák/otomari event), suggesting  a possible cause-and-effect relation between the impact and the extinction. The  result may represent the extinction of as many as 40% of all living marine animal  genera.

TI Contribution of collagen stable isotope biogeochemistry to the paleobiology of
SO Isotopes in environmental and health studies
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB The paleodiet and paleoenvironmental context of two extinct species from Tenerife  island, one giant rat Canariomys bravoi and one giant lizard Gallotia goliath,  have been investigated using carbon and nitrogen isotopic compositions of fossil  bone collagen. Preliminary to this study, a calibration of the isotopic  variations of bone collagen from modern Rat Rattus rattus, Rabbit Oryctolagus  cuniculus and Lizard Gallotia galotti relative to environmental conditions on  Tenerife Islands has been attempted. No clear relationship could be found between  collagen delta13C and delta15N values and aridity; the only relevant factors seem  to be seashore proximity for rat, and the relative amount of C3 and CAM plants.  It seems that anthropic activities have interfered with the expected  relationships between collagen isotopic compositions and environmental  conditions. Most fossil specimens yielded well preserved collagen. The isotopic  composition of giant rat and giant lizard collagen suggest a purely C3  environment, possibly more humid than today on Tenerife. Large ranges of nitrogen  isotopic compositions, especially within giant rats, may be due to local  environmental conditions. Further work is needed in order to provide more  valuable paleobiological information in order to better understand the role of  environmental factors in the evolution and extinction of insular endemic species  on Tenerife.

TI Signatures of random and selective mass extinctions in phylogenetic tree balance.
SO Systematic biology
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB Current models of diversification with evolving speciation rates have trouble  mimicking the extreme imbalance seen in estimated phylogenies. However, these  models have not incorporated extinction. Here, we report on a simple simulation  model that includes heritable and evolving speciation rates coupled with mass  extinctions, Random (but not selective) mass extinctions, coupled with evolving  among-lineage variation in speciation rates, increase imbalance of postrecovery  clades. Thus, random mass extinctions are plausible contributors to the imbalance  of modern clades. Paleontological evidence suggests that mass extinctions are  often random with respect to ecological and morphological traits, consistent with  our simulations. In contrast, evidence that the current anthropogenic mass  extinction is phylogenetically selective suggests that the current extinction  episode may be qualitatively different from past ones in the way it reshapes  future biotas.

AB Oxicam group of non steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs has been chosen as a  prototype molecular group that shows diverse biological functions and dynamic  structural features. Photophysical studies of three drugs from this group viz.,  piroxicam, meloxicam and tenoxicam have been carried out in different solvents  with varying polarity, H-bond character and viscosity. The spectral responses of  different prototropic forms of these drugs towards varying solvent parameters  have been studied, with the aim to characterize their interaction in biomimetic  environment non-invasively. The nature of the lowest transition has been  identified. The extinction coefficient, quantum yield and viscosity dependence on  the nature of the solvents, all indicate the extreme sensitivity of these drugs  to their microenvironment.

TI Fullerenes and interplanetary dust at the Permian-Triassic boundary.
SO Astrobiology
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB We recently presented new evidence that an impact occurred approximately 250  million years ago at the Permian-Triassic boundary (PTB), triggering the most  severe mass extinction in the history of life on Earth. We used a new  extraterrestrial tracer, fullerene, a third carbon carrier of noble gases besides  diamond and graphite. By exploiting the unique properties of this molecule to  trap noble gases inside of its caged structure (helium, neon, argon), the origin  of the fullerenes can be determined. Here, we present new evidence for fullerenes  with extraterrestrial noble gases in the PTB at Graphite Peak, Antarctica,  similar to PTB fullerenes from Meishan, China and Sasayama, Japan. In addition,  we isolated a (3)He-rich magnetic carrier phase in three fractions from the  Graphite Peak section. The noble gases in this magnetic fraction were similar to  zero-age deep-sea interplanetary dust particles (IDPs) and some magnetic grains  isolated from the Cretaceous-Tertiary boundary. The helium and neon isotopic  compositions for both the bulk Graphite Peak sediments and an isolated magnetic  fraction from the bulk material are consistent with solar-type gases measured in  zero-age deep-sea sediments and point to a common source, namely, the flux of  IDPs to the Earth's surface. In this instance, the IDP noble gas signature for  the bulk sediment can be uniquely decoupled from fullerene, demonstrating that  two separate tracers are present (direct flux of IDPs for (3)He vs. giant impact  for fullerene).

TI Population dynamics of HTLV-I infection: a discrete-time mathematical epidemic

LA English
DT Journal Article
AB Human T-cell Leukaemia Virus Type I (HTLV-I) is a retrovirus that causes Adult  T-cell Leukaemia (ATL). The transmission routes of HTLV-I are (i) from infected  mothers to their newborn babies, (ii) from infected males (husbands) to females  (their wives) by long-term sexual intercourse, and (iii) from infected females  (wives) to males (their husbands). Eshima et al. (2001) analysed a  continuous-time HTLV-I model with no age structure in the population. In this  paper, we consider the population dynamics of HTLV-I infection in a discrete-time  mathematical model incorporating an age structure. The necessary and sufficient  condition for the extinction of HTLV-I is derived from the mathematical model. A  simulation of the HTLV-I infection based on the model demonstrates a rapid  reduction of the HTLV-I infection proportion in Japan.

TI Early hominin speciation at the Plio/Pleistocene transition.
SO Homo : internationale Zeitschrift fur die vergleichende Forschung am Menschen
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB Over the last half-decade or so, there has been an explosion in the recognition  of hominin genera and species. We now have the late Miocene genera Orrorin and  Sahelanthropus, the mid Pliocene genus Kenyanthropus, three new Pliocene species  of Australopithecus (A. anamensis, A. garhi and A. bahrelghazali) and a sub  species of Ardipithecus (Ar. r. kadabba) to contend with. Excepting also the more  traditional species allocated to Paranthropus, Australopithecus and early Homo we  are approaching around 15 species over 5 million years (excluding hominin  evolution over the last one million years). Can such a large number of hominin  species be justified? An examination of extant hominid (Gorilla gorilla, Pan  troglodytes, and Pan paniscus) anatomical variability indicates that the range of  fossil hominin variability supports the recognition of this large number of  fossil species. It is also shown that not all hominins are directly related to  the emergence of early Homo and as such have become extinct. Indeed the  traditional australopithecine species 'A'. anamensis, 'A'. afarensis and 'A'.  garhi are considered here to belong to a distinct genus Praeanthropus. They are  also argued not be hominins, but rather an as yet undefined hominid group from  which the more derived hominins evolved. The first hominin is represented by A.  africanus or a hominin very much like it. The Paranthropus clade is defined by a  derived heterochronic condition of peramorphosis, associated with sequential  progenesis (contraction of successive growth stages) in brain and dental  development, but a mixture of peramorphic and paedomorphic features in its  craniofacial anatomy. Conversely, Kenyanthropus and Homo both share a pattern of  peramorphosis, associated with sequential hypermorphosis (prolongation of  successive growth stages) in brain development, and paedomorphosis processes in  cranial, facial and dental development. This suggests, that these two clades  share an important synapomorphy not recognised in the parsimony analyses,  suggesting that they may form a sister group relationship to the exclusion of  Paranthropus. This highlights the need to re-interpret phylogenetic results in  terms of function and development. The rapid speciation and extinction as argued  here is in keeping with other fossil groups in Africa at the Plio/Pleistocene  transition. This emphasises that we must approach the pre-australopithecines and  hominins as part of the endemic African fauna, and not in isolation to the  evolutionary and climatic processes that were operating all around them.

TI New ages for human occupation and climatic change at Lake Mungo, Australia.
SO Nature
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB Australia's oldest human remains, found at Lake Mungo, include the world's oldest  ritual ochre burial (Mungo III) and the first recorded cremation (Mungo I). Until  now, the importance of these finds has been constrained by limited chronologies  and palaeoenvironmental information. Mungo III, the source of the world's oldest  human mitochondrial DNA, has been variously estimated at 30 thousand years (kyr)  old, 42-45 kyr old and 62 +/- 6 kyr old, while radiocarbon estimates placed the  Mungo I cremation near 20-26 kyr ago. Here we report a new series of 25 optical  ages showing that both burials occurred at 40 +/- 2 kyr ago and that humans were  present at Lake Mungo by 50-46 kyr ago, synchronously with, or soon after,  initial occupation of northern and western Australia. Stratigraphic evidence  indicates fluctuations between lake-full and drier conditions from 50 to 40 kyr  ago, simultaneously with increased dust deposition, human arrival and  continent-wide extinction of the megafauna. This was followed by sustained  aridity between 40 and 30 kyr ago. This new chronology corrects previous  estimates for human burials at this important site and provides a new picture of  Homo sapiens adapting to deteriorating climate in the world's driest inhabited  continent.

TI Impact at the Permo-Triassic boundary: a critical evaluation.
SO Astrobiology
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB The recognition in 1980 of a signature of an extraterrestrial impact at the  Cretaceous-Tertiary boundary and its apparent involvement with the mass  extinction generated considerable enthusiasm for impacts at other mass  extinctions. Numerous claims of impact evidence for the Permo-Triassic mass  extinction (251.6 Ma), the largest of the Phanerozoic mass extinctions, have  generally been rejected, found wanting, or been difficult to reproduce. Despite  this lack of repeatable support, considerable available evidence is consistent  with an impact, including the rapidity of extinction, coincident carbon shift,  and evident correlation between terrestrial and marine extinctions. However  attractive the hypothesis, the coincidence with the Siberian flood basalts and  the complex nature of the carbon shift are in conflict with an impact. The most  intriguing possibility is that the greatest mass extinction of the Phanerozoic  left signals very similar to the end-Cretaceous mass extinction but was produced  by entirely Earth-bound processes. If true, this would tell us far more about the  nature of ecosystems and how they fail than would identification of another  impact.

TI Ecological and evolutionary opportunities of apomixis: insights from Taraxacum
SO Philosophical transactions of the Royal Society of London. Series B, Biological
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB The ecological and evolutionary opportunities of apomixis in the short and the  long term are considered, based on two closely related apomictic genera:  Taraxacum (dandelion) and Chondrilla (skeleton weed). In both genera apomicts  have a wider geographical distribution than sexuals, illustrating the short-term  ecological success of apomixis. Allozymes and DNA markers indicate that apomictic  populations are highly polyclonal. In Taraxacum, clonal diversity can be  generated by rare hybridization between sexuals and apomicts, the latter acting  as pollen donors. Less extensive clonal diversity is generated by mutations  within clonal lineages. Clonal diversity may be maintained by frequency-dependent  selection, caused by biological interactions (e.g. competitors and pathogens).  Some clones are geographically widespread and probably represent phenotypically  plastic 'general-purpose genotypes'. The long-term evolutionary success of  apomictic clones may be limited by lack of adaptive potential and the  accumulation of deleterious mutations. Although apomictic clones may be  considered as 'evolutionary dead ends', the genes controlling apomixis can escape  from degeneration and extinction via pollen in crosses between sexuals and  apomicts. In this way, apomixis genes are transferred to a new genetic  background, potentially adaptive and cleansed from linked deleterious mutations.  Consequently, apomixis genes can be much older than the clones they are currently  contained in. The close phylogenetic relationship between Taraxacum and  Chondrilla and the similarity of their apomixis mechanisms suggest that apomixis  in these two genera could be of common ancestry.

AB A thin carbonate unit associated with a Sturtian-age ( approximately 750-700  million years ago) glaciogenic diamictite of the Neoproterozoic Kingston Peak  Formation, eastern California, contains microfossil evidence of a once-thriving  prokaryotic and eukaryotic microbial community (preserved in chert and  carbonate). Stratiform stromatolites, oncoids, and rare columnar stromatolites  also occur. The microbial fossils, which include putative autotrophic and  heterotrophic eukaryotes, are similar to those found in chert in the underlying  preglacial units. They indicate that microbial life adapted to shallow-water  carbonate environments did not suffer the significant extinction postulated for  this phase of low-latitude glaciation and that trophic complexity survived  through snowball Earth times.

SO Physical review letters

DT Journal Article
AB We develop a unified model that describes both "micro" and "macro" evolutions  within a single theoretical framework. The ecosystem is described as a dynamic  network; the population dynamics at each node of this network describes the  "microevolution" over ecological time scales (i.e., birth, ageing, and natural  death of individual organisms), while the appearance of new nodes, the slow  changes of the links, and the disappearance of existing nodes accounts for the  "macroevolution" over geological time scales (i.e., the origination, evolution,  and extinction of species). In contrast to several earlier claims in the  literature, we observe strong deviations from power law in the regime of long  lifetimes.

LA English
DT Review
AB Culture collections have the crucial role of providing the authenticated  biological material upon which high quality research is based. Importantly, they  serve as repositories for strains as part of patent deposits, providers of safe  and confidential services to store key organisms for research and industry, and  sources of organisms cited in scientific papers that can be used in the  confirmation of results and for further study. The demands upon culture  collections change as new technologies and uses of organisms are discovered. Many  are becoming Biological Resource Centres, as defined by the OECD Biological  Resource Centre (BRC) Initiative, in that they operate according to international  quality criteria, carry out essential research, enhance the value and  applications of strains and provide a vital information resource. In a changing  international scientific environment, many collections are under threat of  extinction because of inadequate funding, changing government support strategies  and the cost of new technologies. We are also suffering a decline in the number  of biosystematists, who are needed to form a sound base for molecular  technologies and to aid in identifying, and characterizing microbial diversity.  In this environment, collections must work together to make the best use of new  technologies and to contribute to the description of the 1.4 million fungi yet to  be discovered. At the current rate, this will take 700 years. New technologies  and novel ways of funding this task must be engaged and, above all, scientists  must collaborate. Common policies are necessary to address the regulatory demands  on collections, to control access to dangerous organisms, and, in particular, to  enforce the Convention on Biological Diversity. Countries that hold the majority  of biodiversity require support in building the facilities required to explore  their hidden resource. The World Federation for Culture Collections (WFCC) and,  in Europe, the European Culture Collection Organisation (ECCO) have a key role to  play. The world must benefit from its microbial diversity, which is crucial to  solving increasing problems in food provision, public health and poverty  alleviation.

DE SARS; SARS-CoV; conserved protein motif; evolution; sequence alignment
AB A novel coronavirus has been identified as the causative agent of the severe  acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). For all the SARS-CoV associated proteins  derivated from the SARS-CoV genome, the physiochemical properties such as the  molecular weight, isoelectric point and extinction coefficient of each protein  were calculated. The transmembrane segments and subcellular localization  (SubLocation) prediction and conserved protein motifs search against database  were employed to analyze the function of SARS-CoV proteins. Also, the homology  protein sequence alignment and evolutionary distance matrix calculation between  SARS-CoV associated proteins and the corresponding proteins of other  coronaviruses were employed to identify the classification and phylogenetic  relationship between SARS-CoV and other coronaviruses. The results showed that  SARS-CoV is a novel coronavirus which is different from any of the three  previously known groups of coronviruses, but it is closer to Bo-CoV and MHV than  to other coronaviruses. This study is in aid of experimental determination of  SARS-CoV proteomics and the development of antiviral vaccine.

SO Memorias do Instituto Oswaldo Cruz

DT Journal Article
AB Interactions between two species that result in reduced growth rates for both and  extinction of one of the species are generally considered cases of asymmetric  interspecific competition. Exploitative or interference competition is the usual  mechanism invoked. Here we describe another mechanism producing the same result,  named apparent competition through facilitation (ACF), observed between  Melanoides tuberculata and Biomphalaria glabrata populations. The superior  competitor actually gives some benefit to the other species, whose population  becomes unstable with progressively increasing oscillations, leading to  extinction. A model of ACF using difference equations suggests initial dynamics  distinct from traditional interspecific competition. The dynamics of two  freshwater snails in the field and in laboratory experiments suggest ACF, and  these relations should be considered in studies of schistosomiasis control. ACF  could occur in natural populations, but might have gone undetected because the  final result is similar to traditional interspecific competition.
