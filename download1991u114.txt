AB Two anionic isoperoxidases were isolated from media of Aspergillus flavus-inoculated cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) ovule cultures and purified about 150-fold to apparent homogeneity by treatment with Cell Debris Remover and ion exchange chromatography on Accell QMA medium.  These isoperoxidases were present in noninoculated cotton ovule cultures at low levels.  The major activity peak (B) represented 90% of the recovered peroxidase activity and was electrophoretically homogeneous.  The minor activity peak (A) was about 95% pure.  Isoelectric focusing analysis showed that B was greater than 95% pure with respect to other peroxidase isozymes, while the enzyme in A was about 90% isozymically pure.  Each isoperoxidase displayed a molecular mass of 56 kilodaltons by interpolation from denaturing gel electrophoresis.  The B isozyme displayed a molecular mass of 55 kilodaltons by gel filtration chromatography.  The pH optima for the cotton ovule isoperoxidases were similar, 5.0 for isozyme A and 6.0 for isozyme B.  The isoelectric points for isozymes A and B were 4.2 and 4.4, respectively.  Eugenol, guaiacol, and 3,3',5,5'-tetramethylbenzidine were good electron donor substrates, whereas 4-aminoantipyrine was a poor substrate.  The absorption spectrum of the material in B revealed a major peak at 400 nanometers and a minor peak at 280 nanometers.  The molar extinction coefficient at 400 nanometers (pH 7.0) was calculated to be 1.07 x 10(5) per square centimeter per mole.  Amino acid analysis of isozyme B confirmed the acidic nature of this protein and identified a number of similarities to the anionic peroxidases from tobacco and potato.  This glycoprotein was found to contain 12 to 14% sugar (by weight), mainly in the form of galactose and mannose.

AB The stratigraphic record contains clear evidence that broad regions have experienced rapid changes in sea level unrelated to changes in glacial ice volume (e.g., third- and higher-order Vail sea level variations, continental foundering). We propose that many of these changes can be caused by stress-induced changes in plate density. Stress changes produce significant changes in the density of the crust and lithosphere (a point missed in previous investigations) and propagate across even the largest plates in less than 30,000 years. Lithospheric plates interacting at existing boundaries can produce stress-related density changes sufficient to cause several meters change in plate elevation; these may account for many of the regressions and transgressions seen in the stratigraphic record. The creation of new rifts could increase plate compression enough to cause approximately 50 m of plate subsidence. Plate elevation changes of up to -200 m could result from increased plate compression during continental collisions. A particularly enigmatic kind of rapid nonglacial global (NGG) sea level change is a coupled approximately 50 m sea level fall (regression) and roughly equal rise (transgression) occurring in less than 10(6) years. These couplets, associated with black shales and marine extinctions, can be explained by the elastic snapback attending the rapid formation of a new rift. Isostatic disequilibria along the new rift depresses the seafloor sufficiently to cause a approximately 50 m fall in sea level. Mantle flow restores isostatic equilibrium along the rift axis and erases the fall in approximately 60,000 years. Unusually intense hydrothermal circulation along the new rift during the snapback promotes anoxic bottom water conditions and deposition of black shales. A rapid drop in global sea levels reduces the area of ocean bottom within the photic zone, causing overpopulation, food exhaustion, and extinctions. The connections between changes in plate stress and density have many implications. Perhaps the most far reaching is that tectonic events on the 3/4 of the globe that is covered by oceans, as well as the 1/4 that is subaerial, are recorded in sedimentary strata.

AB The carbon isotope composition of carbonate rocks in time-boundary zones is interpreted as a reflection of the variations in the total biomass at mass extinction events.  Better stratigraphic control and identification of hiatuses can be gained by stable isotope stratigraphic methods than with any other type of stratigraphy.  It is suggested that the use of carbon isotopes can help in solving some of the problems confronting palaeontologists and lead to a better understanding of the evolutionary significance of these events.

AB The Owens Valley millimeter-wave interferometer has been used for high-resolution (approximately 3"-7") mapping of the CO emission in three luminous IRAS galaxies:  IRAS 17208-0014, Zw 049.057 (IRAS 15107 + 0724), and IRAS 10173 + 0828.  These galaxies are among the most extreme, in terms of their L(ir)/L(B) ratio [= nu-F-nu(80-mu-m)/nu-f-nu(0.44-mu-m)], for objects in the IRAS Bright Galaxy Surveys (Soifer et al. 1987, 1989; Sanders et al. 1990).  The CO emission detected in the three galaxies originates from a single region centered on the IRAS emission peak.  Practically all the molecular gas in IRAS 17208-0014 has been detected with the interferometer; a molecular mass of 5.5 x 10(10) M. is located in a 1.2 kpc radius region centered on the infrared nucleus of this galaxy.  Roughly all the molecular gas (approximately 4 x 10(9) M.) in the galaxy Zw 049.057 is located at less than 0.37 kpc from the nucleus.  Lower resolution observations of IRAS 10173 + 0828 are only sufficient to show that approximately half (9 x 10(9) M.) of the total mass of H-2 gas is located at less than 3.2 kpc from the nucleus.  Although the infrared luminosity of IRAS 17208-0014 and Zw 049.057 differ by one order of magnitude, our observations have shown that these galaxies have similar values for the global L(ir)/M(H-2) ratio, for the surface density of molecular gas in their central regions (approximately 10(4) M. pc-2) and for the extinction toward the nucleus (> 300 mag).  Therefore, an extreme infrared luminosity may not be required to find a very high concentration of molecular gas in the nucleus of a galaxy.  Instead, a high L(ir)/L(B) ratio seems to be a good predictor for both a high global L(ir)/M(H-2) ratio and very large central H-2 surface densities.

AB Onshore-offshore patterns of faunal change occurred at many taxonomic scales during the Paleozoic Era, ranging from replacement of the Cambrian evolutionary fauna by the Paleozoic fauna to the environmental expansion of many orders and classes. A simple mathematical model is constructed to investigate such change. The environmental gradient across the marine shelf-slope is treated as a linear array of discrete habitats, each of which holds a set number of species, as observed in the fossil record. During any interval of time, some portion of the species in each habitat becomes extinct by background processes, with rates of extinction varying among both clades and habitats, as also observed in the record. After extinction, species are replaced from within the habitat and from immediately adjacent habitats, with proportions dependent on surviving species. This model leads to the prediction that extinction-resistant clades will always diversify at the expense of extinction-prone clades. But if extinction intensity is highest in nearshore habitats, extinction-resistant clades will expand preferentially in the onshore direction, build up diversity there, and then diversify outward toward the offshore. Thus, onshore-offshore patterns of diversification may be the expectation for faunal change quite independently of whether or not clades originate onshore. When the model is parameterized for Paleozoic trilobites and brachiopods, numerical solutions exhibit both a pattern of faunal change and a time span for diversification similar to that seen in the fossil record. They also generate structure similar to that seen in global diversification, including logistic patterns of growth, declining origination but constant extinction within clades through time, and declining overall extinction across clades through time.

TI VARIABILITY OF THE POST-AGB STAR HR-4049 - DUST OBSCURATION IN A BINARY-SYSTEM

DT Article
DE STARS, CIRCUMSTELLAR MATTER; STARS, INDIVIDUAL; STARS, POPULATION-II
ID giant branch stars; mass-loss; evolution; objects
AB The variability of the peculiar post-AGB star HR 4049 is investigated. The data are 250 photometric observations in the Geneva system, most of which were taken during seven subsequent seasons, near-infrared photometry taken during one season, a few IUE spectra, and some spectroscopic data that are randomly distributed in time. The optical photometry reveals a period of 434 days; the amplitude is inversely proportional to the wavelength. The 434-day period is also distinctly present in the 20 radial velocities we recorded for the star. The length of the period and the amplitude of the velocity variations (2K approximately equal 30 km/s) lead us to the interpretation that HR 4049 is a binary. We note that the present binary nature of HR 4049 argues against coalescence-scenarios for explaining the peculiar abundances of this star. The invisible companion may be a white dwarf, but more probably is a low-mass star which evolves still on the main sequence. The H-alpha line is in emission with either a P Cygni profile or a shell profile. The data suggest a smooth transition from P Cygni to shell and back, correlated with the photometric and radial-velocity variations. The mass flow from HR 4049 is thus altered by the presence of a companion. The photometric variability is best explained by variable extinction of the star by circumstellar matter surrounding the system. The infrared variability can only be explained if the extinction variations reflect a change in the characteristics of dust rather than purely geometric changes.

AB We have analysed the combined Abell-ACO cluster catalogue with m10 less-than-or-equal-to 16.4 which is 80 per cent redshift complete. Taking into account different models of the extinction region we find the cluster dipole pointing within less-than-or-equal-to 10-degrees of the CMB dipole direction which indicates that clusters are tracers of mass. The dipole amplitude converges at approximately 150 h-1 Mpc, within the completeness limit of the catalogue. We find that the anisotropy which is responsible for the LG motion with respect to the CMB rest frame extends in depth and has a scalelength of approximately 300 h-1 Mpc. Most of the Local Group peculiar velocity is induced by matter fluctuations within approximately 50 h-1 Mpc. Shapley's concentration (otherwise known as 'Giant Attractor' or 'alpha region') at a depth of approximately 140 h-1 Mpc, is responsible for less-than-or-equal-to 20 per cent of the Local Group's peculiar velocity. Finally, using linear perturbation theory, we find that OMEGA-0 less-than-or-equal-to 0.3

AB Long-slit spectra at 2.30 and 2.16-mu-m at a spectral resolution of 1200 have been obtained for the nucleus and inner disk of the  Seyfert 2 galaxy NGC 1068 in order to study the stellar population and the ionized and molecular gas at wavelengths where extinction is greatly reduced.  At 6"-12" from the nucleus (inner disk), the CO (upsilon = 0-2) band head is seen in absorption at a level consistent with that seen in late K or early M giants.  It is shallower than that of M82, a prototype of starburst galaxies, by approximately 30%.  Closer to the nucleus, the band head appears progressively weaker.  This may be due to scattered nuclear light.  The stellar velocity dispersion detected at a radius of 3" is 300 km s-1, implying a mass of 5 x 10(9) M. inside 240 pc.  Narrow molecular hydrogen and broad Br-gamma emission lines are detected out to approximately 5" from the nucleus, originating outside the nucleus.

ID electrical-property; thin-film; cuinse2
AB Optical properties of copper-indium-diselenide films were studied in the wavelength range of 500-3000 nm.  The data were analysed in the light of the existing theories and indicated a Burstein-Moss shift in these films.  The dependences of refractive index and extinction coefficient were studied as a function of photon energy and the values of plasma frequency and dielectric constants were generated from the above.  Correlation of the above data indicated an effective mass Mp* = 0.72 Mo, Mo being the free electron mass.

TI INFLUENCE OF SEDIMENT RESUSPENSION ON THE LIGHT CONDITIONS AND ALGAL GROWTH IN LAKE BALATON
SO ECOLOGICAL MODELLING
LA English
DT Article
AB Wind-induced sediment resuspension and its impact on the light conditions were intensively studied in three basins of Lake Balaton, a large shallow lake in Hungary, which is subject to eutrophication. The depth ranges between 2 and 5 m. Frequent observations were made of the wind, the water flows and waves, the suspended solids (ss) concentration, the Secchi disc depth and the light conditions. Four versions of the model were developed for describing the temporal changes in the ss concentration. Models of similar structures were applied for the extinction coefficient and the Secchi disc depth. Several methods were used for calibration. Identifiability and arbitrariness of the model structures have been studied. The extinction model was coupled to a known mass balance equation describing temporal changes in the algal biomass. Sensitivity analysis using hypothetical step-like wind inputs has shown a considerable change in the light limitation factor as compared to the case of steady state winds. Finally, the coupled extinction-algae biomass model was used in a Monte Carlo fashion when longer subsets were selected at random from past wind observations. Late summer conditions and parameters typical for the most eutrophic basin of Lake Balaton (where nutrients are no longer limiting) were selected. The analysis has demonstrated that, in harmony with the observations, the wind has a major impact on the short-term changes of algal biomass. The approach outlined can be utilized to improve the earlier ecosystem models applied for Lake Balaton. The methodology developed is transferable to other shallow lakes.

AB During the Uppermost P. gigas conodont zone (P. linguiformis zone) the stepwise Frasnian extinction culminates in the global transgressive-regressive Frasnian-Famennian >>Kellwasser event<<.  Most pelagic organisms of the tropical marine environment are more or less affected by this mass extinction.  During the early Upper Devonian extinction rates are clearly related to the deposition of black shales and the storage of a great amount of organic carbon in the (shelf) sediments.  Contemporaneous positive excursions of the delta-C-13 recorded from pelagic limestones of Europe and Australia prove a worldwide change in the CO2 content of the oceans surface water which is in balance with the atmosphere.  If the climate is controlled by the CO2 content of the atmosphere, a cyclic operation process might have developed with the succession:  transgression - high organic production - deposition of organic carbon - lowering of CO2 in the atmosphere - icehouse effect - polar glaciation - regression - erosion of organic carbon and resupply of CO2 to the ocean and atmosphere - greenhouse effect - deglaciation - transgression.  During the change from a greenhouse to an icehouse effect an overturn of the anoxic oceans probably was one of the causes for the mass killing of low latitude marine organisms.

TI ECHELLE SPECTROSCOPY OF CD-41-DEGREES-13967 - THE YOUNG CENTRAL STAR OF A NEW PLANETARY-NEBULA
SO ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL

AB High-resolution CCD spectra obtained with the Palomar 60 inch (1.5 m) echelle spectrograph and subsequently confirmed and extended using the CTIO 4 m echelle spectrograph have revealed that the hot star CD -41-degrees 13967 is the young central star of a previously unknown low-excitation planetary nebula.  Presented in this paper is a detailed analysis of our CCD echelle spectra of CD -41-degrees 13967, which are well fitted by non-LTE model atmosphere line profiles corresponding to T(eff) = 27,000 K, log (g) = 3.1, and a He abundance 3 times solar.  These best-fit model parameters imply a mass of 0.63 M. and a post-asymptotic giant branch (AGB) age of 1250 yr for the central star, based on a comparison with central star of planetary nebula (CSPN) evolutionary tracks in the distance-independent T(eff)-log (g) plane.  Using recent UBVRI CCD photometry corrected for extinction along with the Eddington flux emerging from the best-fit non-LTE model atmosphere, we derive a spectroscopic distance estimate of 3.5 kpc to CD -41-degrees 13967.  This together with the Galactic coordinates (l(II) = 359.0; b(II) = -33.5) strongly suggests that CD -41-degrees 13967 belongs to the Galactic halo population, a suggestion supported by the results of our stellar abundance analyses for silicon, [Si/H] = -0.20 +/- 0.10, and oxygen, [O/H] = -0.43 +/- 0.20, as well as by the mean of our stellar radial velocity measurements (<upsilon-r>* = -91 +/- 2 km s-1; compare also with our result, <upsilon-r>PN = -97 +/- 2 km s-1). The surrounding planetary nebula, He 3-1863, shows an angular extent greater than 6" (FWHM) on the E/W slit of our CTIO spectrograms.  The excitation class of the nebula is zero, with only H-alpha, H-beta, H-gamma, H-delta, [N II] 5755, 6548, 6584 angstrom, [O I] 6300, 6364 angstrom, [O II] 7320, 7330 angstrom, and [S II] 6717, 6731 angstrom lines in evidence; lacking is any [O III] 4363, 4959, 5007 angstrom emission.  This is consistent with the low T(eff) determined for the central star.  Subsequent narrow-band H-alpha CCD imaging reveals that He 3-1863 is a centrally concentrated elliptical nebula with a total E/W extent greater-than-or-equal-to 17" and N/S extent greater-than-or-equal-to 13" on the sky.

AB We consider a class of measure-valued Markov branching processes that are constructed as "superprocesses" over some underlying Markov process.  We condition such a process to stay away from the zero measure forever.  We show that if there is a set of traps that will eventually catch the underlying process then the mass of the conditioned superprocess will eventually be concentrated on a single one of these traps.  Moreover, the distribution of the point of eventual concentration is the same as that of the final destination for the underlying process.

TI HIGH-RESOLUTION 1-2-MU-M IMAGING POLARIMETRY OF W75N
SO MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY

DT Article
ID infrared reflection nebula; dark cloud; emission; regions; grains
AB Imaging polarimetry of the star-forming region W75N(OH), taken at J, H and K with seeing-limited (approximately 2 arcsec) spatial resolution, shows that the extended near-infrared emission arises in two separate reflection nebulae.  The bright 2-mu-m peak  IRS - 1 is found to be part of the larger nebula and is not a self-luminous object.  The main illuminating source was not detected, implying direct obscuration of A(v) > 90 mag.  Analysis of the reflected light indicates a much lower extinction (A(v) congruent-to 16 mag) along the reflection path and predicts significant emission from hot dust near the source. Large grains in a narrow size range are expected to dominate the scattering of the near-infrared radiation in the nebula, producing a strongly forward-biased angular dependence in the reflected light.  This may be the cause of the asymmetric appearance of this and many other outflow-related infrared-reflection nebulae, in which the lobe directed away from the observer often appears heavily suppressed. A linear pattern of polarization vectors close to the source of the CO outflow is similar to that seen in other young sources.  Such patterns have been interpreted as evidence of dense disc structures around the illuminating source, but might also arise from multiple scattering in stratified-density geometries that are not disc-like.  There is no clear indication in the near-infrared surface-brightness distribution of any disc structure associated with the outflow at the scale of the resolution or larger. The smaller reflection nebula around IRS - 2 is symmetrically bipolar and appears to be orientated with its axis in the plane of the sky.  The presence of this nebula indicates that IRS - 2 generates a small-scale, lightly collimated outflow of its own.  Improved measurements of the near-infrared hydrogen recombination lines Br-gamma, Br-alpha and Pf-gamma, compared with current models of massive neutral or ionized winds, support the conclusion that IRS - 2 is undergoing significant mass loss.  The line-of-sight extinction toward IRS - 2 is A(v) congruent-to 25 mag. Thirty-nine new low-luminosity sources have been detected at 2.2-mu-m within a 1.2-arcmin2 region.  The K luminosity function of these sources is consistent with that of a single cluster of young stars, showing no significant differences from the distribution found in the Orion cluster.

AB Secondary companions of rapidly spinning pulsars in low-mass systems are expected to be white dwarfs.  Observations of these white dwarfs are expected to provide critical clues to the evolution of magnetic fields of neutron stars and stellar evolution scenarios as well.  We report new radio and optical observations of the 5.4 ms binary pulsar 1855 + 09. Using H I and CO observations we establish the visual extinction to the system to be about 1.5 mag.  Recent timing observations by Ryba et al. have established that the companion or the secondary star has a mass of 0.22 M. and that the system is located more than 290 pc.  We find only one star brighter than R approximately 24.6 that, on the basis of positional coincidence, can be plausibly the optical counterpart of the secondary star.  The spectrum of this candidate is inconsistent with a low-mass main-sequence star.  Neither is it a white dwarf because the spectroscopic distance modulus is inconsistent with the lower limit on distance obtained from timing observations.  The true optical counterpart must be fainter than our detection limit:  R > 24.6 and I > 23.4.  Thus we conclude, as did Callanan et al., that the companion of PSr 1855 + 09 must be a low-mass cold white dwarf.  At the nominal dispersion measure distance of 400 pc, all theoretical models predict a detectable white dwarf, inconsistent with our observations.  However, at the larger distance of 800 pc, favored by the H I data, the upper limits are consistent with an old white dwarf.  The inferred cooling age, while model-dependent, is comparable to 5 x 10(9) yr, the characteristic age of the pulsar.  This result supports the hypothesis that magnetic field strengths of millisecond pulsars are essentially constant and that millisecond pulsars are long-lived objects.  Further improvements in the parallax measurement and deeper images of the field are needed to understand the precise extent of te disagreement between different low-mass white dwarf cooling models and observations.

AB We have discovered that the classical T Tauri star GW Ori is a spectroscopic binary with an orbital period of 242 days.  For a primary mass of 2.5 M., the secondary mass is likely between 0.5 M. and 1M., and the primary/secondary separation is slightly more than 1 AU.  The measured eccentricity of the GW Ori orbit is not distinguishable from zero (e = 0.04 +/- 0.06), although the measurement error is fairly large.  The center-of-mass velocity has been observed to vary over a period of 1000 days, suggesting the presence of a third star in the system or an m = 1 perturbation in the associated disk.  The observed spectral energy distribution of GW Ori shows a large near- and far-infrared excess over the stellar photosphere.  The morphology of the spectral energy distribution is double peaked with a minimum in the continuum near 10-mu-m; in addition there is a very strong 10-mu-m silicate emission feature.  We have considered two theoretical models for the GW Ori system.  A circumstellar disk around the primary star will have a gap which is tidally driven by the companion star.  Our pure-disk model thus consists of a primary star, a circumprimary disk, a circumbinary disk, and optically thin hot dust in the gap between the two disks.  Such a model, with a gap between 0.17 and 3.3 AU, provides a good fit to the observed spectral energy distribution, with the exception of a steep rise in observed luminosity from 13 to 18-mu-m.  The independently determined radius of the secondary orbit falls within this gap, and the width of the gap is dynamically plausible albeit somewhat large.  In this model, the disk components must produce 34L..  A large accretion rate (almost-equal-to 5 X 10(-6) M. yr-1) is required, with no evident boundary layer emission, and the details of the disk luminosity production remain uncertain.  We have considered a second model which replaces the active circumbinary disk with an optically thin shell that reprocesses stellar luminosity into the far infrared.  Such a shell is motivated as residual infall and requires an inner radius of order 100 AU.  This disk-shell model provides a good fit to the observed spectral energy distribution and somewhat relieves the energy demands on the disk.  However, in order to produce the observed far-infrared luminosity, the visual extinction of the shell must be about 2 mag, which is larger than the observed A-upsilon = 0.82 mag.  Additional assumptions regarding our line of sight to GW Ori are thus required.  A circular orbit for a 242 day period binary would be notable given the rarity of circular orbits among long-period main-sequence binaries.  We discuss the significance of the possible circular orbit of GW Ori with respect to the excitation of eccentricity in binary orbits by disks.

TI INTERPRETING CARBON-ISOTOPE EXCURSIONS - STRANGELOVE OCEANS
SO GEOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
ID cretaceous tertiary boundary; atmospheric oxygen; c-13; time
AB Large negative excursions in marine carbonate delta-C-13 are commonly associated with period boundaries and mass extinctions.  Explanations for these events must be consistent with limitations imposed by carbon-isotope mass balance.  At steady state (i.e., for excursions lasting more than 10(5) yr), the surface ocean delta-C-13 is set by the organic fraction of the total carbon burial rate and the magnitude of the photosynthetic isotope effect.  The delta-C-13 of the deep ocean and the surface-to-deep isotope gradient are set by both the organic fraction of the ocean's remineralized particulate flux and the magnitude of the isotope effect.  Thus it is the carbon-isotope composition of the deep ocean that is most reflective of internal oceanic processes; the surface ocean records changes in the longer term throughput of carbon in the system.  The cessation of organic export from the surface ocean, such as is presumed to have caused the Strangelove ocean condition of the Cretaceous/Tertiary (K/T) boundary, leads to an isotopically homogeneous ocean in decades to centuries.  If this condition persists, the ocean's isotopic composition approaches that of the riverine weathering input (in 10(5) yr).  Failure to approach this value during the K/T event suggests continued production and burial of organic carbon, dominantly in either terrestrial or shallow-marine environments.

AB Evolutionary progress is a trend that relaxes trade-off rules.  It begins with the evolution of a key adaptation.  It continues with the spread of the key adaptation as the clade that contains it replaces some older clade that lacks it.  Key adaptations are those that allow for improvement in at least one organismal function at a reduced fitness cost in other functions. Replacement almost certainly involves more than pure chance.  It may not often involve competitive extinction.  Instead, species from the new clade produce new species to replace already extinct species from the old clade.  The key adaptation gives them a higher competitive speciation rate than old-clade sources of replacement.  The process, termed incumbent replacement, proceeds at a rate limited by extinction rate.  Thus, replacement often seems linked to mass extinction events. The incumbent-replacement hypothesis explains what we know about the replacement of straight-neck turtles (Amphichelydia) by those that can flex their necks and protect their heads in their shells.  This replacement occurred four or five times in different biotic provinces.  It happened as long ago as the Cretaceous in Eurasia, and as recently as the Pleistocene in mainland Australia.  It was accomplished in Gondwanaland by turtles flexing their necks sideways (Pleurodira), and in the north by those flexing their necks into an S-curve (Cryptodira).  As is typical of replacements, amphichelydian replacement took millions of years to accomplish wherever it occurred, and much of it in North America took place in a burst associated with and immediately subsequent to a mass extinction.

TI DUST EXTINCTION AND THE INITIAL MASS FUNCTION IN THE STARBURST GALAXY M82
SO MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY
LA English
DT Note
ID infrared-emission; line; nucleus; stars
AB The apparently low extinction towards the nucleus of M82 inferred from optical and near-IR recombination line and continuum studies (A(v) approximately 5 mag) may be reconciled with the much larger values inferred from mid-IR and longer wavelength measurements (A(v) approximately 25 mag) if the dust and radiating sources are well mixed along the line-of-sight.  Existing near-IR data, which potentially could delineate the three-dimensional dust distribution, are of insufficient accuracy.  If the large extinction derived from long-wavelength data attenuates the emission from giant and supergiant stars, then the initial mass function in M82 may be deficient in low-mass stars.

TI THE MOLECULAR-STRUCTURE OF A STARBURST - (CO)-C-13 IN THE NUCLEUS OF MAFFEI-2

AB We present high-resolution (approximately 6") maps of the (CO)-C-13 emission in the nucleus of the nearby spiral galaxy Maffei 2 made with the Owens Valley Millimeter Interferometer. The optically thin (CO)-C-13 emission, a tracer of H-2 gas density, indicates that the molecular cloud distribution in the nucleus of Maffei 2 is remarkably well-correlated with the starburst as traced by radio continuum emission. Evidently the molecular density distribution determines the spatial structure of this starburst. The observed range of (CO)-C-13 emission implies H-2 column densities of N(H-2) = 0.13-1.3 x 10(32) cm-2, molecular surface densities of sigma-H-2 = 200-2000 M. pc-2, and visual extinctions of A(V) = 14-140 mag on size scales of approximately 150 pc. The molecular material forms a barlike structure 40" (1 kpc at an assumed distance of 5 Mpc) in extent, with a total H-2 mass of M(H-2) = 2.3 x 10(8) M.. Two dynamical components are evident in the (CO)-C-13 maps:  a region within approximately 120 pc of the nucleus that appears to rotate rapidly as a solid body; then nearly Keplerian fall-off to a less-rapidly rotating region extending to a radius of approximately 500 pc. The most intense star formation activity appears in the inner solid body region of the rotation curve. Within the solid body region, gas accounts for approximately 40% of the estimated dynamical mass. The centroid of the molecular mass is offset by approximately 120 pc from the dynamical center of the galaxy. Since the dynamical time scale against winding by differential rotation is approximately 10(6) yr, some mechanism must contribute to the longevity of this nuclear bar structure, possibly spiral density waves.

AB The nature of the hot component in symbiotic binaries is still controversial. The existence of a hot radiative source is inferred from the presence of a photoionized nebula. The nebular spectrum points to typical radiation temperatures of T* almost-equal-to 100 000 K. The bulk of the ionizing radiation is therefore emitted below 1200 angstrom, the effective short end of IUE (International Ultraviolet Explorer). We set ourselves the task of deriving temperatures and luminosities for the hot component of a representative sample of symbiotic systems. For that purpose the Zanstra method is adapted to the special requirements of symbiotic stars. T* is basically derived by comparing the nebular recombination line He II lambda-1640 with the underlying continuum. We allow for the fact that at this wavelength the observed continuum originates in the hot stellar source as well as in the nebula. By comparing in addition the continuum flux at 1640 angstrom with the nebular Balmer continuum at the long end of the IUE wavelength range, we can distinguish particle bounded from radiation bounded nebulae. We have looked at all symbiotic stars observed by IUE. For the symbiotic stars emitting He II-lambda-1640 we find 0.3 L. less-than-or-similar-to L less-than-or-similar-to 37 000 L. and 55 000 K less-than-or-similar-to T* less-than-or-similar-to 210 000 K. The derived radii range approximately from 0.002 R. to 0.8 R.. In addition, we determine interstellar extinctions E(B-V). Where binary periods are known, we have estimated mass-loss rates for the red giants; typical values are M(c) almost-equal-to 10(-7) M.yr-1. As several symbiotic systems have been suggested to possess accretion disks, we have searched the spectra for such signatures, however, we found no evidence for permanent disks emitting a substantial fraction of the ionizing radiation. From our investigation it appears that the hot components in symbiotic systems lie on the post red giant track. In some cases this may be a white dwarf, in others it may be closer to the central star of a planetary nebula, and in other cases it is a white dwarf in a slow nova-like outburst, which may last for decades. The two stars in a symbiotic system are thus a red giant and a post red giant. The system as a whole is at a late state of stellar evolution.

AB The real and imaginary refractive indexes of organic-based nonvolatile aerosols produced by burning vegetation are reported for the infrared spectral region. The data were obtained by an iterative Kramers-Kronig analysis of the transmission spectra (2-25-mu-m) obtained from thin-film samples deposited on a KBr substrate immersed directly in the smoke plumes of small-scale test fires. The results include samples from fires fueled by lawn grass, alfalfa, mesquite, tumbleweed, pine needles, and mixed twigs, leaves, and weeds. The most significant characteristics of all spectra are as follows: (a) strong absorptions in the 3-5-mu-m region owing to condensed water and CH3/CH2 groups of aliphatic hydrocarbons; (b) characteristic peaks in the 6-, 8-, and 10-mu-m regions owing to skeletal modes of aromatic and terpenic groups; and (c) relatively little absorption in the 10-12-mu-m region. The imaginary refractive index of all samples is comparable (approximately 0.10-0.30) in the 3-5- and 8-10-mu-m regions and is 3-10 times lower in the 10-12-mu-m region. In the 3-5-mu-m region, most of the absorption takes place in the interval between 3 and 4-mu-m as opposed to the 4-5-mu-m interval which shows significantly less absorption. It is also noteworthy that there is insignificant absorption in the 2.0-2.5-mu-m window region. Results are significantly different from values for elemental carbon which are known to be relatively wavelength independent in these spectral regions and of magnitude between approximately 0.50 and 1.0 for the imaginary index. Theoretical calculations, assuming particle sizes in the Rayleigh scattering regime, yields a mass extinction coefficient (m2/g) for the organic smokes on the order of approximately 0.20 for the 8-10-mu-m region and as high as 0.40 at 3-mu-m to near zero at 5-mu-m in the 3-5-mu-m window.

TI REEF-BUILDING GUILDS AND A CHECKLIST FOR DETERMINING GUILD MEMBERSHIP - A NEW APPROACH FOR STUDY OF COMMUNITIES
SO CORAL REEFS

AB The need for rapid descriptive and interpretive surveys of diverse and structurally complex communities has led to several field techniques for use by taxonomic non-specialists. A new approach to such surveys is the application of Root's guild concept to reef communities. In addition to its taxonomic simplicity, other advantages of the reef guild concept include its applicability to a great variety of reef community types: e.g. both living and fossil, shallow and deep water, diverse and depauperate. Additionally, the impacts of geologic mass extinction events on reef communities may be more readily interpreted by changes in guild structure. Assignment of individuals, colonies and taxa to one of the three reef-building guilds (i.e. Constructor, Baffler, Binder) is based on three fundamental skeletal properties: (a) dominant growth direction in relation to the substrate, (b) functional morphology and (c) skeletal size and strength/rigidity. These properties, combined with aspects of the occurrence and distribution of the skeletons, are used to create a hierarchical checklist for guild assignment consisting of six criteria (which range from 1 as most important to 6 as least important): (1) habit; growth habit, (2) life-form; growth form, (3) skeletonization; skeletal strength/rigidity, (4) skeletal volume; coloniality, (5) biostratonomy; taphonomy and (6) skeletal packing density. To demonstrate the method of determining guild membership, these criteria are used for analysis of the algae and sponges in the Upper Capitan Limestone (Late Permian), Guadalupe Mountains, New Mexico. Such analysis indicates that the guild structure of this reef community is quite similar to those in other algal-sponge Late Carboniferous-Middle Triassic reefs and very dissimilar to those in Oligocene-Holocene reefs.

AB The relationship between optical line flux and 5 GHz radio flux is investigated for a sample of 17 northern sky symbiotic stars.  Data were obtained near-simultaneously with the Manchester Echelle Spectrograph mounted on the Isaac Newton Telescope, La Palma and the Broad Band Interferometer at Jodrell Bank.  Colour excesses, calculated from Balmer hydrogen line fluxes assuming Case B recombination ratios, are compared with other reddening estimates and also combined with extinction maps to provide improved distance estimates.  Optical line fluxes are used in combination with radio fluxes to estimate physical parameters of these objects, including mass-loss rates.  The suggestion that the ionized regions of D-type symbiotics are much more extensive than those in S-type is confirmed.  This in turn strengthens the hypothesis that S-type symbiotics are more likely to be undergoing Roche-lobe overflow than their D-type counterparts.

AB In the winter of 1987-1988, a field study was undertaken to identify the principal causes of visibility impairment in Denver so that a plan to improve air quality could be designed.  One focus of the field study was the measurement of the mass of sulfate, nitrate, organic and elemental carbon in particles as a function of particle size.  The analysis of those measurements led to the following conclusions:  (1)  emissions of ammonia in areas northeast of Denver contribute to the mass of fine particle ammonium nitrate in Denver; (2)  soot is much less efficient at scattering light than the other constituents of the Denver brown cloud, and much more efficient at absorbing light; (3)  meteorological conditions that produce episodes of visibility impairment in Denver can be distinguished by the associated size distribution of airborne fine particles and (4)  a significant fraction of the particle mass of organic carbon measured in the 1987-1988 Denver Brown Cloud Study could have been adsorbed gases.

TI VACUUM ULTRAVIOLET IMAGERY OF THE VIRGO CLUSTER REGION .3. DIFFUSE FAR-ULTRAVIOLET RADIATION AT HIGH GALACTIC LATITUDES

AB Far-ultraviolet radiation over a wide sky region of -110-degrees < l < 60-degrees and b > 60-degrees was observed by a rocket-borne two-dimensional imager in the wavelength around 150 nm. The background far-ultraviolet radiation from the Virgo cluster region was also observed in the pointing phase of the same rocket experiment. Contributions from several components, such as airglows, faint stars, or molecular hydrogen emission, to the observed radiation were examined, and the diffuse far-ultraviolet background radiation at high Galactic latitudes was derived. The results showed a steep dependence of the background radiation on the Galactic latitude b, and the radiation flux in the region of b > 70-degrees and of N(H I) < 3 x 10(20) cm-2 to be 300-600 photons cm-2 s-1 angstrom-1 sr-1. A clear correlation of the background radiation with the hydrogen column density N(H I) was obtained in the region of b > 70-degrees. The correlation was confirmed by the background radiation in the Virgo cluster region, indicating that major part of the background radiation is Galactic origin. The observed steep dependence on b cannot be explained easily by simple models of light scattering by interstellar dust grains with uniform source distribution. We propose a model of light scattering by dust with anisotropically distributed far-ultraviolet stellar sources in the Galactic disk. Comparison of the model calculation with the observation indicates that, as for scattering properties of the interstellar dust grains, the albedo a is larger than 0.32 and the scattering phase asymmetry factor g is greater than 0.5. These results are in agreement with some theoretical predictions. The regression line of the observed flux versus N(H I) intercepts with the ordinate axis at 200 to 300 photons cm-2 s-1 angstrom-1 sr-1, in which the Galactic isotropic component and the extragalactic component are involved. The difference in the background radiation between inside and outside the Virgo cluster was shown to be less than 2 photons cm-2 s-1 angstrom-1 sr-1. This can set an upper limit to the decay light of neutrinos from the Virgo cluster, and a lower limit of about 6 x 10(24) s to be lifetime of the heavy neutrinos of the mass around 15 eV c-2, if the mass of the Virgo cluster derived from the X-ray observations is allocated to heavy neutrinos.

AB An astrometric, photometric, and spectroscopic investigation of the loose open cluster NGC 225 is presented.  The proper motions of 289 stars (cluster + field) have been measured, with errors ranging from 0.10 to 0.25"/century, on PDS scans of astrometric plates spanning a time interval of up to 88 yr.  A total of 28 members down to B = 16.1m have been identified.  V magnitude and (B - V) color index have been determined for all 289 stars with means errors of about 0.04m and 0.07m, respectively, while spectral classifications have been obtained for 62 stars.  The cluster NGC 225 is of low mass (60M. less-than-or-equal-to M(TOT) less-than-or-equal-to 88 M.), young (t = 1.2 x 10(8) yr), nearby (r = 525 +/- 73 pc), moderately obscured (<E(B-V)> = 0.25 +/- 0.08), and with a marked differential reddening.  The more massive stars are concentrated towards the cluster core; they seem to move more slowly than the less massive stars, which would indicate relaxation and energy equipartition.  Also, a possible runaway has been identified and a real deficiency of less massive stars seems to be present.

AB The occurrence of protochlorophyllide b and protochlorophyllide b phytyl ester in green plants is described.  The chemical structure of protochlorophyllide b phytyl ester was established by proton nuclear magnetic resonance, fast atom bombardment mass spectroscopic analysis, and chemical derivatization coupled to electronic spectroscopic analysis.  The macrocycles of protochlorophyll(ide) b are identical to those of conventional protochlorophyll(ide) except for the presence of a formyl group instead of a methyl group at position 3 of the macrocycles.  They differ from chlorophyll(ide) b by the presence of an oxidized double bond at positions 7 and 8 of the macrocycles.  The trivial name protochlorophyll(ide) b is proposed to differentiate these two tetrapyrroles from conventional protochlorophyll(ide), which in turn will be referred to as protochlorophyll(ide) a.  Protochlorophyll(ide) b appears to be widely distributed in green plants.  Its molar extinction coefficients in 80% acetone and diethyl ether are reported.  The impact of this discovery on the heterogeneity of the chlorophyll a and b biosynthetic pathways is discussed.

AB We describe the nonrandom assembly of the North American terrestrial mammalian fauna based on body size and spatial scale. The frequency distribution of body masses among species for the entire continental fauna was highly modal and right skewed, even on a logarithmic scale; the median size of the 465 species was approximately 45 g. In contrast, comparable frequency distributions for 24 small patches of relatively homogeneous habitat were essentially uniform, with approximately equal numbers of species in each logarithmic size class; the median sizes of the 19-37 species ranged from approximately 100 to 2,500 g. Frequency distributions for 21 biomes (large regions of relatively similar vegetation) were intermediate between the continental and local assemblages. This pattern of assembly indicates that species of modal size (20-250 g) tend not to coexist in local habitat patches and they replace each other more frequently from habitat to habitat across the landscape than species of relatively large or small size. We hypothesize that three mechanisms are necessary and possibly sufficient to produce this result: competitive exclusion of species of similar size within local habitats, differential extinction of species of large size with small geographic ranges, and greater specialization of modal-sized species owing to energetic and dietary constraints.

AB The inefficiency of the stellar formation process leads rather generally to high residual dust densities, and so to the existence of infrared reflection nebulosity (IRN), in regions of star formation.  Polarization images of several star-forming regions with mass outflows (GSS 30, S255, GL 5180, GL 2591, GGD 27, and NGC 7538) presented here (1) establish the universality of bipolarity and of shell or cavity structure in the IRN consistent with that of CO outflow, (2) identify the source of the mass outflow in each case, (3) show that the opening angle near this central source is large, and (4) demonstrate several instances of multiple shells, probably arising from episodic mass loss.  Astrometry of 2.2-mu-m sources with arcsecond accuracy identifies the illuminating source of each IRN uniquely with a compact H II region or a bright IR source.  The polarization images provide strong evidence for large-scale dust toroids around each of these sources.  The density and mass of these disks are estimated from the extinction through the disk.

AB If mass extinctions were caused by reduced primary productivity, then extinctions should be concentrated among animals with starvation-susceptible feeding modes, active lifestyles, and high-energy budgets.  The stratigraphic ranges (by stage) of 424 genera of bivalves and 309 genera of articulate brachiopods suggest that there was an unusual reduction of primary productivity at the Cretaceous/Tertiary (K/T) boundary extinction.  For bivalves at the K/T, there were (1) selective extinction of suspension feeders and other susceptible trophic categories relative to deposit feeders and other resistant categories, and (2) among suspension feeders, selective extinction of bivalves with active locomotion.  During the Permian-Triassic (P/Tr) extinction and Jurassic background time, extinction rates among suspension feeders were greater for articulate brachiopods than for bivalves.  But during the K/T event, extinction rates of articulates and suspension-feeding bivalves equalized, possibly because the low-energy budgets of articulates gave them an advantage when food was scarce.

AB Taxon-age distributions were compiled for families of marine animals surviving or becoming extinct in each stage of the Phanerozoic.  I demonstrate, through the use of a modified bootstrap analysis, that there is no difference between the longevity of families becoming extinct during times of background extinction and times of mass extinction.  In both mass and background extinction intervals the mean age of families that become extinct is 2 standard deviations below the geometric mean taxon age of families available for extinction.  Young families are more susceptible to extinction, perhaps as the result of lower species richness or of occupying a smaller geographic range.  There is no tendency during mass extinctions toward loss of families with different taxon ages other than those that become extinct during background times.  Thus, in terms of family survival, mass extinction appears to be an exaggeration of processes of background extinction.

AB We present ultraviolet results from a multiwavelength campaign on the low-mass X-ray binary Sco X-1. The ultraviolet observations were obtained with the International Ultraviolet Explorer (IUE) and coincided with X-ray observations taken with the Japanese satellite Ginga and other observations from numerous between the strengths of the UV continuum and line fluxes and the X-ray spectral states. Models predicting UV continuum emission from the X-ray - heated surface of the companion star and from an X-ray - illuminated accretion disk were adjusted for parameters intrinsic to Sco X-1 and fitted to the data. The data/model comparison shows the following for Sco X-1, as for Cyg X-2:  (1) X-ray heating of the accretion disk is the dominant source of UV emission, (2) the mass accretion rate increases monotonically along the so-called Z-shaped curve in an X-ray color-color diagram, and (3) the disk structure does not change as a function of X-ray spectral state. The accretion disk model gives a best-fit outer disk radius of (6.3 +/- 0.3) x 10(10) cm. Mass accretion rates range from 0.6 x 10(-8) M. yr-1 in the normal branch (NB) to 1.1 x 10(-8) M. yr-1 in the flaring branch (FB). The horizontal branch (HB) was not observed simultaneously in the UV and X-ray, but if the weakest state seen from earlier UV observations corresponds to the HB state, the mass accretion rate there is found to be 0.4 x 10(-8) M. yr-1. Ultraviolet emission lines from He, C, N, O, and Si were detected; all increase in intensity from the HB to the FB state.  A model in which emission lines are due to photoionization of the outer disk by the X-ray source was developed and gives good agreement with the line fluxes observed in each state. The X-ray:UV:radio flux ratios of Sco X-1 measured at the lower vertex of the Z in the X-ray color-color diagram agree with those previously observed in five other X-ray binaries.  We suggest that the flux at this vertex, which several theories identify with an accretion rate at the Eddington limit, may be used as a standard candle; the distance to Sco X-1 would then be 2.0 +/- 0.5 kpc.

AB Scanning Fabry-Perot interferometry of the dwarf galaxy UGC 2259 in the [OIII] lambda-5007 angstrom line is presented. The velocities of twenty [OIII] emission regions belonging to the galaxy were measured. From two separate data cubes, we obtained the rotation curve of the galaxy in the radial range 0.25 - 2.5 kpc. The velocity field is regular and does not show large deviations from pure circular motion. The new high spatial resolution data of the central part of the galaxy, together with previous HI measurements of the outer parts, are used to analyse the detailed mass distribution in the system. A disk model, with mass following the radial luminosity profile, can not produce the observed rotation curve. A satisfactory fit is obtained by adding a dark halo component. At the Holmberg radius, the amount of dark matter in UGC 2259 then would be between 0.7 and 0.8 times the luminous mass in the disk. This value is in the range of the dark-to-luminous mass ratios in brighter galaxies. The mass-to-light ratio obtained for the disk is 5.6-5.7. An alternative two component mass model is presented, without a halo, but containing two separate disk components, one conforming the stellar distribution, the second meant to represent the distribution of visual light obscuring material. A satisfactory fit to the observed rotation curve has been obtained straightforwardly, with both the inter-relation between the two components and the resulting extinction properties in agreement with recent constraints, as obtained from the analysis of the optical properties of ESO-LV disks (Valentijn 1990a,b). As an example, we also present a similar two-disk fit to the Sc galaxy NGC 3198. The evidence for opaque disks, also in dwarf Sc's and the avoidance of the ''disk-halo conspiracy'', seem to favour the two-disk solution over the disk-halo solution. We also determine the size distribution of the HII regions in UGC 2259 and obtained a scale diameter of 26 pc in agreement with the value expected for low luminosity spiral galaxies.

AB We present submillimeter photometry and high spatial resolution 800-mu-m and 450-mu-m maps of the cold, low-luminosity source IRAS 4 (T(d) = 33 K, L approximately 28 L.) in the active star formation region NGC 1333. IRAS 4 is resolved into a binary system, with components separated by approximately 31" and connected by a bridge of faint dust emission. The submillimeter flux density from the two components is unusually bright [S4A(800-mu-m) approximately 12.7 Jy; S4B(800-mu-m) approximately 8.6 Jy]; IRAS 4A is marginally resolved into a disklike structure 3200 x 2200 AU in size. The spectral energy distribution of 4A is best explained by optically thick dust emission shortward of 1.1 mm. We derive a total gas and dust mass of 9.2 M. for 4A and 4.0 M. for 4B. These correspond to average gas densities of 9.0 x 10(9) cm-3 and 9.2 x 10(8) cm-3, respectively, and imply a line-of-sight visual extinction of approximately 7 x 10(4) mag and approximately 1 x 10(4) mag for 4A and 4B, respectively. The dust masses associated with the binary components are by far the largest seen toward any star of comparable luminosity and are a factor of 10 higher than predicted by theoretical models of protostars. We propose that we are seeing an extremely young stellar system, possibly a true protostar, in which most of the luminosity is the result of the accretion process.

TI ESCALATING PREDATION ON CRINOIDS IN THE DEVONIAN - NEGATIVE COMMUNITY-LEVEL EVIDENCE
SO LETHAIA
LA English
DT Article
ID mesozoic marine revolution; new-york; paleoecology; indiana; ontario
AB Previous morphological studies suggest that predation on stalked crinoids increased in the Devonian.  However, there was no concomitant decline in the occurrence of dense, shallow-water stalked crinoid assemblages in North America from the Ordovician and Silurian to the Mississippian.  The evolution of crinoid defensive adaptations may have kept pace with rising durophagy, forestalling the expected decline of crinoid communities.  It is also possible that the demise of reefs after the Frasnian-Famennian mass extinction indirectly decreased predation pressure on crinoids by removing shelter for predatory fish.  A third possibility is that stalked crinoid abundance was affected neither by new predators nor by the decline of reefs.

TI HOW COMPLETE ARE CRETACEOUS TERTIARY BOUNDARY SECTIONS - A CHRONOSTRATIGRAPHIC ESTIMATE BASED ON GRAPHIC CORRELATION

AB Cogent interpretations of data bearing on the Cretaceous/Tertiary (K/T) extinction controversy depend on the existence of accurate chronostratigraphic models for the various K/T boundary sections. We have employed the graphic correlation technique to summarize biostratigraphic and lithostratigraphic data from 15 intensively sampled K/T boundary sections within a common chronostratigraphic model. Our results indicate that almost all of these sections, along with 13 additional boundary sections not used to construct the model, contain prolonged and in many cases multiple hiatuses. Of these 28 boundary sections, only six were found to contain a continuous record of sediment accumulation across the K/T boundary itself. These six K/T-complete sections are El Kef (Tunisia), Agost (Spain), Caravaca (Spain), and three sections along the Brazos River (Texas). A comparative analysis of hiatus distributions among these 28 K/T boundary sections also reveals the presence of systematic differences between continental-shelf and deep-sea depositional environments. The lower Danian interval immediately following the K/T boundary, and extending into biochronozones PO and P1a, is typically missing from the deep sea, whereas boundary sections deposited in shallower middle-neritic to upper-slope environments are in most cases complete across the K/T boundary. These shallow, neritic boundary sections, however, are in many instances disrupted by hiatuses at the P0/P1a boundary and again in the upper part of Zone P1a. These differential patterns of hiatus distribution between deep-sea and continental-shelf depositional settings appear to be linked to sea-level fluctuations. Our data suggest that the apparently sudden mass extinction of planktonic Foraminifera and anomalies in the occurrence of geochemical tracers that are characteristic of the K/T boundary in deep-sea sections may be artifacts of a temporally incomplete deep-sea stratigraphic record.

AB The galactic OB association Cygnus OB2 contains a wealth of heavily reddened O and B stars, including VI Cyg No. 12, one of the most luminous and heavily reddened stars known.  We have studied this association using CCD UBV photometry and spectroscopy.  The photometry has allowed us to isolate the intrinsically blue stars; spectroscopy has then provided accurate MK spectral types for determining effective temperatures and hence bolometric corrections.  We show how the two-color diagram can be used to separate foreground from association memberships by using the large minimum reddening [E(B - V) > 1.2]; galactic associations with more moderate reddening will suffer confusion of fore-ground F and G stars with reddened stars of mid-to-late B type.  The resulting H-R diagram shows a well-defined, clean main sequence, with a few slightly evolved supergiants of lower mass, suggesting that star formation was not strictly coeval, similar to what is seen in OB associations in the Magellanic Clouds.  The initial mass function of Cyg OB2 is found to have a slope of gamma = -1.0 +/- 0.1, considerably flatter than that previously found for massive stars in the Galaxy and for most regions studied in the Magellanic Clouds.  Finally, we discuss the nature of the very luminous star VI Cyg No. 12.  This star is the most visually luminous star known in the Galaxy and lies in a position of the H-R diagram well above the upper luminosity cutoff found by Humphreys & Davidson [ApJ, 232, 409 (1979)].  It is also the most heavily reddened star known optically (A(v) almost-equal-to 10 mag).  Data presented here and elsewhere suggest that the star is slightly variable both photometrically and spectroscopically, and we speculate that it is an incipient Hubble-Sandage variable (i.e., a Luminous Blue Variable), and that the high luminosity coupled with high extinction is in fact not a coincidence, but evidence of a previous episode of mass loss.

TI SUDDEN EXTINCTION OF THE DINOSAURS - LATEST CRETACEOUS, UPPER GREAT-PLAINS, USA

DT Article
ID tertiary boundary; mass extinctions
AB Results of a three-year field study of family-level patterns of ecological diversity of dinosaurs in the Hell Creek Formation of Montana and North Dakota show no evidence (probability P < 0.05) of a gradual decline of dinosaurs at the end of the Cretaceous. Stratigraphic reliability was maintained through a tripartite division of the Hell Creek, and preservational biases were corrected for by comparison of results only from similar facies as well as through the use of large-scale, statistically rigorous survey and collection procedures. The findings are in agreement with an abrupt extinction event such as one caused by an asteroid impact.

TI MISSISSIPPIAN PELMATOZOAN COMMUNITY REORGANIZATION - A PREDATION-MEDIATED FAUNAL CHANGE
SO PALEOBIOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
ID mesozoic marine revolution; comatulid crinoids; phylogeny
AB Crinoid genera of the subclass Camerata generally dominated Late Silurian through Middle Mississippian pelmatozoan echinoderm assemblages.  This dominance reached a peak during the early and middle Mississippian (Kinderhookian-Meramecian), but abruptly ended at the close of the Genevievian Stage (= lowermost Chesterian) in eastern North America.  During the Genevievian Stage, crinoids of the subclass Inadunata became taxonomically more diverse but a few camerates, especially Platycrinites and Batocrinus, continued to be numerically dominant in many pelmatozoan assemblages.  In eastern North America, platycrinids and batocrinids were reduced drastically near the Genevievian-Gasperian boundary.  So obvious is this faunal change that, until recently, the Meramecian-Chesterian Series boundary was recognized as the last occurrence of Platycrinites penicillus.  The sudden and drastic decline of numerically dominant platycrinids and batocrinids in eastern North America suggests a mass extinction, but is better interpreted as a range contraction and loss of dominance.  Platycrinids, in particular, continued to be significant components of pelmatozoan assemblages in Europe and Asia long after the end of the Genevievian Stage.  We infer that this reorganization of pelmatozoan assemblages in eastern North America was a product of predation, siliciclastic tolerance, and current-energy preference, with predation playing a major role.  Reorganization resulted in post-Genevievian dominance by (1) cladid crinoids, (2) camerate crinoids that were cladid homeomorphs, and (3) the blastoid Pentremites.  Foraminifera, conodonts, corals, brachiopods, bryozoans, and other echinoderm groups were affected little, if any, during this same time.

AB The directionality of long-term trends can be strongly biased by forces intrinsic to a clade.  Trends in body size and skeletal shape may be dictated more by variations in survivorship that reflect differences in ecology than by long-term directional changes in the environment.  Hence, mass extinctions can help drive evolutionary trends by selectively eliminating some morphologies and permitting the survivors to found the next radiation. Examples include repeated trends toward larger maximum body size and the evolution of keeled species from those with globose tests in planktonic forminifera.  Both the trends in size and shape develop because small species with globose tests are significantly more resistant to extinction than species that are large or have peripheral keels.  Hence, the survivors of both the Cretaceous-Tertiary and Eocene-Oligocene extinction episodes are small, unkeeled taxa.  Large species and species with keels evolved convergently after both mass extinctions as the founders radiated anew. Comparison of three radiations of planktonic forminifera suggest that the convergent evolution of similar test shapes and sizes is not due to synchronous changes in oceanography that track evolutionary trends.  Instead, the reestablishment of habitat heterogeneity is needed to permit the ensuing radiation to unfold rather than to closely guide its progress.  Similar evolutionary trends will develop in each radiation as long as the founders have similar morphology and the evolution of variants present in the previous radiation is not precluded by the environment.

TI 1ST RESULTS FROM THE GODDARD HIGH-RESOLUTION SPECTROGRAPH - SPECTROSCOPIC DETERMINATION OF STELLAR PARAMETERS OF MELNICK 42, AN O3F STAR IN THE LARGE MAGELLANIC CLOUD

AB GHRS and optical (ESO 3.6 m) observations of the O3f star Melnick 42 in the 30 Doradus complex are reported. A first analysis reveals that with a luminosity of 2.3 x 10(6) L. and a present mass of 100 M., Melnick 42 is one of the most luminous and massive stars known. An estimate of abundances indicates that iron and oxygen are very likely reduced by a factor of 4 relative to the Sun, whereas carbon is more strongly depleted and nitrogen is approximately solar. The terminal velocity of the stellar wind is 3000 km s-1. The mass-loss rate is 4 x 10(-6) M. yr-1, with a large uncertainty. The excellent quality GHRS spectrum taken in a crowded region of the LMC demonstrates the superiority of the HST for quantitative ultraviolet spectroscopy of hot stars in other galaxies.

TI INFRARED PROPERTIES OF IRAS SOURCES ASSOCIATED WITH NEARBY DARK MOLECULAR CLOUDS
SO MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY
LA English
DT Article
ID t-tauri stars; dense cores; spectral evolution; point sources; protostars; extinction; objects; cluster
AB We present an analysis of the infrared properties of a sample of IRAS sources associated with nearby dark molecular clouds. Examination of the luminosities and distribution of sources in colour-colour space suggests that they are T-Tauri stars and younger 'embedded cores', with mass typically approximately 1 M.. The broad range of colour temperatures as a function of wavelength implies the presence of extended circumstellar dust components with considerable temperature variations. Sources which are optically visible on the Palomar Observatory Sky Survey plates generally have colour temperatures higher than for invisible sources, although the difference is not large. In particular, we identify a subset of sources which have embedded core colours and yet are optically visible, illustrating that the IRAS data alone are not sufficient to distinguish between the youngest 'protostellar' sources and certain more evolved premain-sequence stars. We combine the IRAS data with existing broad-band photometry between approximately 1-mu-m and 20-mu-m to construct the spectral energy distributions (SED's) for a small number of sources. By comparing the SED's with theoretical models, the young stellar objects can be classified in terms of their evolutionary status. Statistical arguments are used to extend the classification to the rest of the sample. In the notation of Lada, the optically visible sources with embedded core colours are likely to be class 11-D sources, representing a transient phase between protostar and visible premain-sequence star. We estimate that the duration of the class I phase is approximately 2 x 10(5) yr and derive a similar result for the 11-D phase. This conflicts with analogous results for the embedded cluster in rho-Ophiuchus.

AB Balloonborne particle counter data from Laramie, WY are used to define a seasonally averaged stratospheric sulfuric acid aerosol size distribution in three altitude intervals from 15 to 30 km for the 1980-1987 period.  This period includes the volcanic eruptions of Mt. St. Helens, Alaid, Nyamuragira, El Chichon, and Nevado del Ruiz and begins and ends at what are believed to be periods of near background (nonvolcanic) stratospheric conditions.  The size distributions are used to calculate lidar backscatter to extinction, mass, and area ratios for an appropriate range of particle indices of refraction.  These ratios may then be used to infer particle extinction, mass, and area from midlatitude lidar data for this time period.

AB A normal reference interval for serum amyloid P component (SAP) concentration in the serum was established in 500 healthy adult individuals (274 women, 226 men), by electroimmunoassay calibrated with standards of highly purified, isolated SAP.  The mass of SAP in these was determined from the extinction coefficient of SAP at 280 nm measured here precisely for the first time by spectrophotometry and cryogenic drying.  The mean (SD, range) SAP concentration was significantly lower in women:  24 mg/l (8, 8-55), compared to 32 mg/l (7, 12-50) in men (P < 0.001).  In renal insufficiency patients, 38 with chronic renal failure, 79 on hemodialysis and 66 on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis, the mean values for SAP concentration were all significantly higher than normal (range of means, 39-59 mg/l in men and 35-42 mg/l in women), but did not correlate with serum creatinine, duration of dialysis or the presence of an acute phase response.  The metabolism of SAP is thus altered in renal failure and is not normalized by dialysis, but it is not clear whether this is relevant to the pathogenesis of dialysis related arthropathy and amyloidosis.

AB A water-soluble, highly polar, heat-stable, small molecule has been isolated from cell-free extracts of the halotolerant green alga Dunaliella salina.  This compound, soluble inhibitory factor (SIF), when added to in vivo light-activated, thylakoid membrane-bound preparations of the D. salina coupling factor 1 (CF1), causes a rapid inactivation of the ATPase activity.  SIF must be in its oxidized form to inactivate the CF1 ATPase and probably functions by oxidizing the reduced form of the light-activated enzyme.  SIF has been purified to homogeneity and characterized by UV-visible and IR absorption spectroscopy, H-1 and C-13 NMR spectroscopy, and mass spectrometry.  SIF has different kinds of nonexchangeable protons and seven different kinds of carbon atoms. Three of the carbon atoms and one proton are part of a heterocyclic (imidazole) ring.  One carbon atom is a carbonyl (carboxylic acid).  One carbon atom and three protons form a methyl group attached to the aromatic ring.  one carbon atom and two protons are a methylene group, and one carbon atom (an alpha-amino carbon) is attached to a single proton.  In addition, in its reduced form, SIF contains a thiol group attached to the heterocyclic ring.  From high resolution mass spectrometry, the molecular weight of SIF was determined to be 401 (M + H+) and is consistent with the composition being C-14-H21N6O4S2.  The UV absorption of SIF shows a large increase at 240 nm upon reduction.  An effective difference extinction coefficient for this absorbance change has been calculated to be 6.84 meq/cm.  A comparison of SIF with the oxidized form of ovothiol A (1-N-methyl-4-mercaptohistidine disulfide) shows the two compounds to be identical in all respects.  In addition, ovothiol A disulfide is as effective as SIF in inhibiting the light-triggered, CF1 ATPase activity.  It is concluded, therefore, that SIF and L-1-N-methyl-4-mercaptohistidine disulfide are identical.

AB A common method of estimating the attenuation capabilities of military smokes/obscurants is to use a band-averaged mass extinction coefficient with concentration length values in the Beer-Bouguer transmission law.  This approach ignores the effects of source spectra, sensor response, and normal atmospheric attenuation on broadband transmittance characteristics, which can significantly affect broadband transmittance.  The differences that can occur in predicting relative transmittance as a function of concentration length by using band-averaged mass extinction coefficients as opposed to more properly computing the bandaveraged transmittance are discussed in this paper.  Two examples are provided to illustrate the differences in results.  The first example considers 3- to 5-mu-m and 8- to 14-mu-m band transmission through natural fogs.  The second example considers 3- to 5-mu-m and 8- to 12-mu-m transmission through phosphorus-derived smoke (a common military obscurant) produced at 17% and at 90% relative humidity.  Major differences are found in the values of concentration lengths predicted by the two methods when the transmittance relative to an unobscured atmosphere falls below about 20%.  These results can affect conclusions concerning the detection of targets in smoke screens, smoke concentration lengths required to obscure a target, and radiative transport through polluted atmospheres.

AB A mathematical model of droplet combustion in surroundings of hot gas with a uniform free stream motion is made from the numerical solution of the conservation equations of heat, mass and momentum in both the carrier and droplet phases.  The gas phase chemical reaction between fuel vapor and oxidizer is assumed to be a single-step irreversible one.  The phenomena of ignition is recognized by the sudden rise of temperature in the temperature-time histories at different locations in the carrier phase.  The relative influences of pertinent input parameters, namely initial Reynolds number Re(i), ratio of free stream to initial drop temperature T-infinity, and the ambient pressure on:  (i) the ignition time lag, (ii) extinction characteristics, and (iii) life histories of burning fuel drops have been established.

ID carmarthen district; south-wales; trilobites; boundary
AB Studies of the fates of clades during mass extinctions at the end of the Cretaceous and near the Cambrian-Ordovician boundary have indicated that geographically widespread groups have a much higher probability of survival than narrowly distributed groups.  If biogeographic distribution does play a significant role in influencing the outcome of extinction events, then geographic variability in extinction intensity should be mirrored by patterns of endemism.  A comparison of data for the terminal Cambrian extinction indicates that survival of trilobite families in Kazakhstan was significantly greater than in North America.  As predicted, the Kazakh sequence was characterized by a significantly larger number of pandemic families.  The Baltic Province, which includes Scandinavia, England, and Wales, was composed entirely of pandemic groups and did not suffer any trilobite extinction at the family level.  The results are consistent with the suggestion that latitudinal variation in extinction magnitude may be the result of differences in biogeographic structure.

AB This article concerns a combined analytical and numerical study of finite rate exothermic chemical reactions in a one-dimensional fuel strip embedded in an oxidizing medium.  The fuel and oxidizer undergo time dependent in-plane straining motion resembling a fuel strip that is being continuously stretched by the local velocity gradients in a turbulent oxidizer field.  The analytical part of the approach makes use of the Shvab-Zel'dovich formulation of species and energy equations under the assumptions of equal species mass diffusivities and unity Lewis number.  Numerical solution of the fuel species equation is combined with the analytic solutions of the Shvab-Zel'dovich variables to determine the structure of the combustion field.  Influence of different strain histories on fuel consumption is presented for a generic second-order chemical reaction with Arrhenius temperature dependence and unit stoichiometry.  The strain histories include linearly increasing and decreasing strain rates with time and sinusoidal strain rate variations with different frequencies resembling strain rates in fluctuating flow fields.  The results show significant influence of strain history on fuel consumption behavior.  Straining results in considerable enhancement of combustion rates, although thermal quenching is experienced at high strain rates.  Combustion behavior during low- and high-frequency oscillations in the strain rate can be quite different in that the flame does not fully respond to high-frequency oscillations.  On the other hand, low-frequency oscillations can considerably enhance combustion rates.

AB The Siberian Traps represent one of the most voluminous flood basalt provinces on Earth. Laser-heating 40Ar/39Ar data indicate that the bulk of these basalts was erupted over an extremely short time interval (900,000 +/- 800,000 years) beginning at about 248 million years ago at mean eruption rates of greater than 1.3 cubic kilometers per year. Such rates are consistent with a mantle plume origin. Magmatism was not associated with significant lithospheric rifting; thus, mantle decompression resulting from rifting was probably not the primary cause of widespread melting. Inception of Siberian Traps volcanism coincided (within uncertainty) with a profound faunal mass extinction at the Permo-Triassic boundary 249 +/- 4 million years ago; these data thus leave open the question of a genetic relation between the two events.

AB A series of monomeric oxomolybdenum(V) complexes of the type LMoO[X-CHR'-CHR"-Y] (L = hydrotris(3,5-dimethyl-1-pyrazolyl)borate; X = O, Y = S, R' = Me, R" = H or R' = R" = H, Me; X = Y = O, S, R' = R" = Me) have been synthesized.  Several monoalkoxo and monoalkanethiolato complexes with the general formula of LMoO(Cl)(XR) (X = O, R = Me, Et, (n)Pr; X = S, R = Et, (n)Pr, (i)Pr) also have been prepared.  All of these complexes have been characterized by elemental analyses, mass spectrometry, infrared and UV-visible spectroscopy, electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy, and cyclic voltammetry.  The electronic absorption spectra for chelate complexes with X = Y = O or S show two transitions with similar extinction coefficients in the range 400-900 nm.  The energy difference between these two bands is approximately 3400 and 3600 cm-1 for X = Y = O and S, respectively.  In the potential window +2.0 to -2.0 V, all of these complexes exhibit one quasi-reversible reduction wave, corresponding to forming the analogous monoxomolybdenum(IV) species.  The reduction potentials shift to the negative direction with an increase in the number of methyl groups on the chelate rings and with an increase in the number of methylene units in the monodentate alkoxo or alkanethiolato ligands.

ID diffuse fraction
AB Based on the instantaneous global and diffuse radiation measurements made in Abu Dhabi, UAE, during 1987, the instantaneous values of the clearness index, diffuse fraction, atmospheric transmittance, and extinction coefficient were estimated and found to be strongly dependent on the air mass and month of the year.  Therefore, correlations between each of these parameters versus the air mass and month of the year were developed using the least-squares technique.  The diffuse fraction may alternatively be correlated against the clearness index and the air mass with no seasonal influence.  The beam transmittance was estimated theoretically using the two-layer atmospheric model and making use of the correlation developed previously for the extinction coefficient.  The model was found to yield satisfactory results.  The diffuse transmittance was also estimated theoretically using both the RSC model and the isotropic scattering model with good agreement with the data obtained.

AB The strong ridge of CO emission in the Vela direction discovered in the May et al. (1988) wide angle 0-degrees.5 resolution survey is analyzed in detail. Correlations with optical and radio tracers, supplemented by CO kinematic data, show there is a concentration of giant molecular clouds behind the Vela supernova remnant at a distance of almost-equal-to 1-2 kpc. The total mass of the clouds suggests that they may form a portion of the spiral arm feature as discussed previously by May et al. The central part of one of the Vela clouds, designated region C, was mapped at higher 8.8' resolution and was found to consist of three clumpy, warm, massive fragments, with numerous indications of recent and widespread massive star formation. Region C may also contain unusually high chemical abundances.

AB We report on the continued study of the most luminous hot stars in galaxies of the Local Group, with the aim of studying their spectroscopic and wind characteristics, and comparing them with similar Milky Way stars. We present results from ground-based optical and IUE UV observations of five bright blue stars in M33 and four in M31. Four of the M33 stars are in two close pairs. We discuss these together with the previously published results on five stars. We discuss the limits of feature detectability in faint IUE spectra. Where possible, we have derived spectral classifications and fit continuum models to the data, from U-V and visible range spectra, and visible range photometry. The stars are all O, B or W-R type of high luminosity. As reported previously, we have continued to find that, compared with Galactic counterparts, the UV line spectrum and the stellar wind indicators are weak. We have also found that the UV extinction law in both M33 and M31 stars is steeper than the Galactic law, and similar to that found in the LMC. We discuss the evidence for stellar and extinction anomalies in our Galaxy, and conclude that our sample stars are disk objects in M33 and M31.

AB Using the 3.6 m Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope (CFHT), we have obtained B, V, and R CCD images of a large field in the nearby galaxy NGC 253, sampling portions of both the inner and outer disk regions (Scoville et al. 1985).  The data were recorded during conditions of exceptionally good seeing, permitting individual stars to be resolved over a large area of the galaxy.  Two-color and color-magnitude diagrams are constructed, and it appears that the majority of the stars we have detected are supergiants of spectral types A, F, and G.  We find that (1) the difference in mean visual extinction between the inner and outer disk is approximately 1 magnitude; (2) the apparent brightnesses of the most luminous stars in the inner and outer disk regions are similar which, given the difference in mean extinction, suggests that the former area contains stars which are intrinsically brighter, and hence more massive, than in the latter; and (3) if A(V) does not exceed approximately 2 magnitudes, the majority of the stars we have detected have masses less than or equal to 40 M..  Finally, the luminosity functions in all three bandpasses of stars in the outer disk region follow power laws, with slopes similar to those seen in other spiral galaxies.  The brightest red supergiants occur at V approximately 19.0 and, if these stars are similar to those in other nearby galaxies, then the distance modulus of NGC 253 is less than or equal to 27.0.

TI THE OPTICAL COUNTERPART OF IRAS 12496-7650 - A HIGHLY EMBEDDED HERBIG AE STAR

AB We report optical and near-infrared observations of IRAS 12496 - 7650, an active young star and the most luminous IRAS source in the Chamaeleon II dark cloud.  The object has become brighter at optical wavelengths since 1976, and has exhibited brightness variations of more than a magnitude at K between January 1987 and May 1990.  IRAS 12496 - 7650 is redder when fainter, and the amplitude of the brightness fluctuations decreases towards longer infrared wavelengths.  Differing amounts of circumstellar extinction or intrinsic color variations of the source can produce most of the observed variability.  Optical spectra confirm that IRAS 12496 - 7650 is an extremely active (probably Herbig Ae type) star with blueshifted forbidden lines of [O I] and [S II] and a prominent P-Cygni profile at H-alpha.  The [S II] emission extends 3-4 arcsec on either side of the star and shows a significant velocity gradient, suggestive of a jetlike structure.  The detection of outflowing material from IRAS 12496 - 7650 reinforces earlier evidence that this object is the exciting source for the HH 52-54 group Herbig-Haro objects.  The broad spectral energy distribution suggests that IRAS 12496 - 7650 has a circumstellar disk.

AB When carrying out a survey of IRAS sources with infrared colours similar to those of planetary nebulae, IRAS 22568 + 6141 was found to be a new young planetary nebula. It shows an extension of 8" and a bipolar structure. From its optical low resolution spectrum we have derived a high extinction E(B-V) = 2.37, an electronic temperature of T(e) = 11 500 K and an electronic density of N(e) = 2 10(4) cm-3. Making use of the Shklovskii modified method and considering an infrared excess <IRE> = 37, we have estimated a distance of 6 kpc. This value is consistent with the H-alpha radial velocity V(LRS) = - 80 km s-1 derived from the high resolution spectrum. An expansion velocity of 70 km s-1 is found for the nebula, which combined with the adopted distance gives a kinematical age of 1800 years. From the IRAS data a total dust + gas envelope mass of 0.4 M. is inferred. This implies that a mass loss rate phase of M greater-than-or-equal-to 10(-5) M. yr-1 has been necessary to form the nebula. The exciting star has an effective temperature of T(eff) = 24 000 K. The elemental abundances values, its position in the HR diagram, the infrared characteristics and its kinematical age indicate that this is a young planetary nebula with a 1 M. progenitor.

AB During a 38-day period in the fall of 1987 a wide range in the visual quality of the atmosphere at Research Triangle Park, North Carolina was observed.  Throughout the period, the light scatter coefficient; SO2, NO2, and O3 concentrations; temperature; relative humidity; and radiation intensity of the atmosphere were continuously monitored.  Additionally, 60 filter samples were intermittently collected with two dichotomous (course and fine particle) size-selective samplers.  The dichotomous samplers were operated concurrently to obtain samples on Teflon and quartz filters for different analyses.  Also collected were six impactor samples for sulfate size distribution analysis.  At selected times during the study, long-path measurements were made of the atmospheric extinction coefficient and the extinction of contrast by the atmosphere. The primary results were as follows:  (1) The average light scatter coefficient to fine particles mass ratio was 4.55 m2/g, and this ratio varied from a low of around 3 m2/g when the scatter coefficient was around 0.05/km to a high around 6 m2/g when the scatter coefficient increased to around 0.4/km.  (2) Elemental measurements of the compositions of the particulate samples showed that sulfur dominated the elemental composition of the fine fraction but was generally below the detection limit in the coarse fraction.  Quantifiable amounts of Si, Al, K, Fe, Ca, Mg, Ti, and Cu were found in both size fractions.  (3) Carbon measurements of the particulate samples showed the elemental carbon content of the atmosphere was only around 2 percent of the mass concentration, and the volatile carbon (VOC) content was around 17 percent.  Most of the elemental carbon content was in the fine fraction, while the volatile carbon content was generally equally divided between the coarse and fine fractions.  (4) Sulfate particle size distribution measurements indicated a mass distribution peak between 0.5 and 1.0-mu-m diameter and a large mass fraction around 38 percent below 0.25-mu-m diameter.  (5) Measurements of the light scatter coefficient were on average 22 percent lower than light extinction measurements.  The major reasons for this difference at this site appears to be due to elemental carbon absorption and nephelometer error.

AB We show that the brightest star in the most important H II region of the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) is a multiple system. The zero-age main sequence (ZAMS) mass of this star drops significantly from the previously estimated value of 130 or 110 M. to less than 85 M. while its present mass falls from 113 M. to 58 M., both due to multiplicity and extinction correction. This is another piece of evidence against the existence of stars more massive than approximately 100 M. in the SMC. We also show that the present mass of one of the two known O3 stars in the SMC is significantly smaller than presently believed.

TI STEPWISE MASS EXTINCTIONS - THE CASE FOR THE LATE CENOMANIAN EVENT
SO TERRA NOVA
LA English
DT Article
AB The various extinctions of marine taxa in the Late Cenomanian can be shown as conforming to the 'step-wise extinction' model.  The order of such extinctions is, however, compatible with the presence of an expanded oxygen minimum zone in the world ocean.  The occurrence of iridium anomalies at this level in the succession may, however, indicate a volcanogenic control on the global environment.  Detailed time-analysis of the Late Cenomanian event has been used to produce a correlation of some key successions.

TI ANALYSIS OF TRANSIENT COMBUSTION OF A MULTICOMPONENT LIQUID FUEL DROPLET
SO COMBUSTION AND FLAME
LA English
DT Article
ID vaporization; gas
AB The transient combustion of a multicomponent liquid fuel droplet has been studied.  The unsteady effects caused by the liquid- and gas-phase processes are considered.  The numerical results demonstrate that due to the process of fuel vapor accumulation within the inner region to the flame and to the high liquid-phase mass diffusional resistance, a situation is reached where the concentration of fuel vapor in the inner zone of the flame or in the immediate vicinity of the droplet surface exceeds that at the droplet surface for certain values of the liquid-phase Lewis number.  This results in a suppression of the mass vaporization rate (i.e., negative vaporization rate) without any indication of flame extinction.  The results also indicate that with the increase in the volatility differentials between the mixture constituents vaporization is suppressed earlier in the droplet lifetime.  However, by decreasing the liquid Lewis number, this phenomenon can be eliminated and the complete droplet lifetime can be computed.  For example, the numerical results show that for a 50-50 by mass heptane-decane droplet, a liquid-phase Lewis number larger than three results in suppression of vaporization.

AB The depositional history of Upper Miocene through Recent sediments from DSDP Site 214 (Ninetyeast Ridge, Indian Ocean) is reexamined. Samples of the Globorotalia tumida planktic foraminiferal lineage, originally obtained from these sediments by Malmgren et al. (1983), serve as the empirical basis for the recognition of punctuated anagenesis as a distinct mode of phenotypic evolution and have been the subject of numerous additional investigations. However, conclusions reached by previous authors depend strictly on the validity of the original chronostratigraphic interpretation of these sediments. Graphic correlation analysis of first- and last-appearance datum levels for a total of 41 planktic foraminiferal, radiolarian, and calcareous nannoplankton taxa provides evidence for a more complex depositional history at this deep-sea site than originally believed. Based on a conservative model of variation in the pattern of sediment accumulation rates, the lowermost portion of the studied section (6.5-4.3 Ma) represents an an interval of temporally condensed sediment accumulation (1.88 cm/1,000 yr) followed by an interval (4.3-2.8 Ma) of temporally expanded sediment accumulation (3.97 cm/1,000 yr). This interval, in turn, is followed by a depositional hiatus or an extremely condensed interval, at least 800,000 yr in duration, which is followed by another relatively condensed (1.36 cm/1,000 yr) interval from 2.0 Ma-Recent. Although this chronostratigraphic reinterpretation deviates substantially from the original, which recognized Site 214 as being both temporally continuous and exhibiting a constant sediment accumulation rate from the Upper Miocene through the Upper Pliocene, it is more consistent with expectations based on Neogene eustatic sea-level fluctuations and global surveys of Neogene hiatus distributions. Age assignments for samples of the Gr. tumida lineage based on the revised chronostratigraphic model reverse some findings of previous investigators with respect to the distinctiveness of phenotypic evolutionary rates characterizing the transition from Gr. plesiotumida to Gr. tumida. Finally, a brief survey of similar marine invertebrate lineage studies shows that changes in the rate of phenotypic evolution often appear to coincide with major physical changes in the paleoceanographic environment. Such correspondences may be due, at least in part, to the effect of these environmental changes on sediment accumulation rates. Paleobiologists who seek to understand patterns of phenotypic change over time must remove the effects of variations in sediment accumulation rates from their data before evolutionary hypothesis testing and remain aware of the limitations imposed on their interpretations by the uncertain nature of chronostratigraphic inference.

AB We have mapped the inner region of Maddalena's cloud, a massive, cold object in the outer Galaxy, in both (CO)-C-12 and (CO)-C-13 (J = 1-0) using the FCRAO 14 m telescope.  The visual extinction has been determined by star counts and is used to investigate the gas and dust properties of the cloud. Our results indicate that the (CO)-C-13 column density to visual extinction ratio is similar to that found in local molecular clouds.  This suggests that if the gas to dust ratio is normal, the CO abundance is similar to that of the clouds near the Sun.  The masses derived from the LTE and virial analyses differ by a factor of 5; the virial analysis gives a mass 5 times larger than the LTE value.  The structure and kinematics of the cloud inferred from the CO maps suggest that the inner region of the cloud may be expanding.  Thus, both the kinematics of the cloud and the mass discrepancy suggest that this object may not be gravitationally bound.  If we assume the LTE mass to be correct, the ratio of molecular hydrogen column density to CO integrated intensity is 0.7 x 10(20) cm-2 (K km s-1)-1, much lower than that found for most GMCs in the inner Galaxy.

AB Infrared transmission spectra of the atmosphere above 11-km altitude were obtained in December 1982 and April/May 1983 from a NASA Convair 990 aircraft. The observations on the first flight series encompassed low and middle latitudes in the northern hemisphere, while the observations on the second series covered a wide range of latitudes in both hemisphere. We have analyzed these data to derive the optical depth of the El Chichon volcanic cloud at a wavelength of 8.4-mu-m. Comparison of these values with concurrent measurements by Dutton and DeLuisi of the cloud's optical depth at 0.5-mu-m leads to the ratio of the cloud's infrared to visible optical depth, R. We analyzed the observed spectra by rationing pairs of spectra taken at similar latitudes, but different air masses and comparing these ratio spectra with synthetic ones. The synthetic spectra allow for absorption by gases (O3, H2O, CO2, CH4, and N2O) as well as extinction by the cloud particles. Extinction by the cloud particles is particularly important in the 8- to 9-mu-m region. We obtain an average value for R of 0.25 +/- 0.05. Our data imply that concentrated sulfuric acid was the dominant source of aerosol extinction in the 8- to 12-mu-m window region of the Earth's atmosphere and that the volume modal particle radius equalled 0.6 +/- 0.1-mu at the time of our observations. At these times, the volcanic particles produced a significant warming of the lower stratosphere and had a nontrivial impact on the radiation budget of the troposphere and ground in the northern hemisphere.

ID dispersal events; horse equus; pliocene
AB Monodactyly developed independently in at least four distinct equid lineages:  Astrohippus, Pliohippus, the two closely related genera Hippidion and Onohippidium and the lineage represented by Protohippus, Dinohippus and Equus.  While Astrohippus and Pliohippus did not survive past the Hemphillian (late Miocene to earliest Pliocene), Hippidion and Onohippidium survived until the end of the Pleistocene or beginning of the Holocene, and Equus survives today with six species in the Old World.  In spite of a remarkable uniformity in body structure this genus dispersed over five continents and gave rise to a rich evolutionary radiation, adapting to a variety of habitats and diverse, even extreme climates.  Six lineages differentiated within it between the late Pliocene and the early Pleistocene.  One of these, represented by Equus stenonis and its descendants, six to eight species in all, became extinct during the middle Pleistocene, with a possible survival into the late Pleistocene in the Indian peninsula.  The other five lineages survived until the end of the Pleistocene, when they were represented by no less than 27 species.  This should be considered a minimum estimate:  several poorly known species are not considered here.  There were never critical periods of mass extinction and many species disappeared through evolutionary change, resulting in the radiation of the final Pleistocene.  The South American genera Hippidion and Onohippidium also dispersed widely and survived into the final Pleistocene or early Holocene with an unknown, but probably restricted number of species.  In view of their remarkable capacity of adaptation, the dramatic decline of equids in number of species, and in the case of Eurasia in number of individuals of the surviving species, can hardly have been caused by climatic factors alone and is believed to be largely the result of prehistoric overkill.

ID superprocesses
AB We consider a dynamic multilevel population or information system.  At each level individuals or information units undergo a Galton-Watson-type branching process in which they can be replicated or removed.  In addition, a collection of individuals or information units at a given level constitutes an information unit at the next higher level.  Each collection of units also undergoes a Galton-Watson branching process, either dying or replicating.  In this paper, we represent this multilevel branching model as a measure-valued stochastic process, study its moment structure, identify the limiting continuous-state approximation and analyse the long-time behavior in both non-critical and critical cases.  For example, we obtain an asymptotic expression for the extinction probability for the total population mass process and an analogue of Yaglom's conditioned limit theorem in the critical case.

AB We present a set of evolutionary population synthesis models which are used to study the properties of the star formation episodes taking place in starburst regions.  We investigate the effects of different star formation scenarios.  As limiting cases we consider an instantaneous burst and a continuous rate of star formation.  Previous models have been improved by using stellar evolutionary tracks of Z = Z. and Z = Z./10 metallicity which include the effects of overshooting and mass loss, and by taking a very small time step (greater-than-or-equal-to 0.05 Myr), so that the evolution of the cluster can be followed even during very short phases.  At variance with previous models we have performed the synthesis in two different steps.  We have first synthesized the population of massive stars in a young cluster as a function of age, IMF and metallicity.  In a previous paper we have discussed the synthesis of the stellar population and have compared the predictions with O and WR stars counts.  Here we present a set of observational parameters which have been computed using a compilation of spectra and fundamental properties of stars.  This compilation has been made combining model atmospheres with observational data taken from the literature.  Different observational parameters have been synthesized:  the ratio of the Si IV and C IV UV absorption lines, the WR bump at 4650 angstrom, the H-beta luminosity and equivalent width, the ratio of the ionizing to the UV flux at 1440 angstrom, the effective temperature of the cluster, the far infared and the radio emission and the spectral energy distribution in the range 1000 angstrom -2.2-mu-m, including the stellar and the nebular contributions.  We discuss the evolution of all these parameters during 20 Myr and their sensitivity to the properties of the star formation scenario (IMF slope and upper mass limit, metallicity and star formation rate).  The ratio of UV Si IV and C IV absorption lines and the parameters related to the ionizing flux are very useful to constrain the age of the star-forming region.  They are also very sensitive to the IMF slope because they depend strongly on the relative population of massive stars.  W (Si IV)/W (C IV) and W (H-beta) are especially useful parameters because they are independent on reddening and normalization.  At Z./10 metallicity the general evolution of the cluster is slower and the contribution of red supergiants is much smaller, so that at a given age the effective temperature is higher and the ionizing flux stronger than at solar metallicities.  The detection of the bump due to WR stars at 4650 angstrom can also constrain the age of the cluster within a period of less than 3 Myr, especially at low metallicity.  The radio spectral index allows to discriminate between very young bursts dominated by thermal emission and older ones where the number of supernova remnants is significant.  The UV extinction law and the corresponding color excess can be derived comparing the observed and predicted UV spectral distributions, providing that the far infrared luminosity can be derived comparing the observed far infrared luminosity is correlated with the intensity of the Balmer lines only for galaxies in the same evolutionary stages, since the ratio L(FIR)/H-beta can vary by up to three orders of magnitude in 20 Myr. The V - K color index is a powerful tool to discriminate between red supergiants and red giants.  Comparing the predictions of the models with data taken from the literature we have seen that while for some objects the V - K colors can be well reproduced, for others the predicted values are too blue, indicating that the contribution of red giant stars is important, and that therefore there must have been star formation previously to the present burst.

ID interstellar grains; astronomy; model
AB The rigorous Kerker-Matijevic formulae for light scattering by co-axial double cylinders are used to calculate the extinction properties of hollow organic grains. A size distribution of such particles together with iron whiskers of radii 0.01-mu-m, silica spheres of radius 0.03-mu-m and free aromatic molecular clusters comprised of 50-100 atoms yield excellent agreement with data on the extinction of starlight. The mass ratios of silica to organics and of iron to organics are in good accord with cosmic abundance constraints.

AB IRAS Pointed Observations are used to study the pre-main sequence (PMS) objects associated with the reflection nebula Cederblad 110 in the Chamaeleon I star forming cloud. Nine PMS stars are identified, and near-infrared observations are presented and combined with IRAS data to investigate their evolutionary status. The nine objects represent various low-mass PMS stages from deeply embedded protostar candidates to naked T Tauri stars approaching the ZAMS, indicating that star formation has been going on for millions of years in the immediate vicinity of Cederblad 110. The two youngest PMS objects, Ced 110 IRS4 and Ced 110 IRS6, are projected on to the densest gas of the Chamaeleon I cloud suggesting an on-going star formation process in the Cederblad 110 region. Ced 110 IRS4 (L(bol) = 1.4 L.) and Ced 110 IRS6 (L(bol) = 1.0 L.) are both at the early stage of evolution where outflows can occur. We observed their immediate vicinity in the (CO)-C-12 line in order to detect high-velocity molecular gas. Emissions which are red- and blueshifted with respect to the cloud velocity appear to be spatially correlated with Ced 110 IRS4. According to the morphology of the (CO)-C-12 wing emission map, Ced 110 IRS4 is the most probable exciting star of Herbig-Haro objects 49 and 50.

TI DIRECT PRODUCTION OF FV-FRAGMENTS FROM A FAMILY OF MONOCLONAL IGGS PAPAIN DIGESTION
SO MOLECULAR IMMUNOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
ID anti-morphine antibody; amino-acid sequence; escherichia-coli; binding-sites; light-chains; immunoglobulin; heavy
AB Fv fragments of four monoclonal antibodies specific for morphine binding have been produced from their divalent IgG forms by papain digestion using the classic procedure for Fab formation. The binding characteristics of one of the Fv fragments have been determined relative to the intact antibody by equilibrium dialysis. Its dissociation constant is a factor of five lower than the IgG. Previous work had resulted in the sequences of each the chains for the four Fv fragments. The light chains are all from the highly homologous-lambda-subclass while the gamma-heavy chains are closely related except for their CDR regions. In this work optical molar extinction coefficients are predicted from amino acid sequences for each of the fragments. It is found that they differ significantly from each other and from the commonly used value for intact IgG. Detailed comparisons between our results and those reported previously on the molecular masses of Fv-derived light and heavy chains and hapten-Fv dissociation constants are given based on analytical gel electrophoresis and electroblotting experiments using dye and immunovisualization techniques. Isoelectric focusing experiments have been performed and the pIs obtained are compared to those predicted theoretically from the chain sequences. Gel filtration column chromatography, acrylamide gel electrophoresis and equilibrium dialysis experiments are consistent with significant aggregation of the Fv fragments in neutral solution with accompanying inactivation of the binding site. Comparison of sequences for the Fv light and heavy chains are made with those which have been proposed to be important for chain dimer association and for canonical hypervariable regions. This method of Fv production is not regarded as a general one. However, it may be an approach which is general to lambda-chain containing antibodies.

AB The imminent launch of the NASA Gamma Ray Observatory has focused on the need to provide up-to-date estimates of the energy density of interstellar radiation away from the galactic plane, this parameter being a prerequisite for calculation of the flux of gamma rays coming from the inverse Compton interactions of cosmic ray electrons.  We have made such calculations, using recent information on stellar distributions and on the extinction properties of dust in the interstellar medium.  The ensuing energy densities are probably accurate to about 30%, the uncertainty being due to lack of precise knowledge of the input parameters rather than approximations in the calculations.

AB Using published data of the IRAS minisurvey galaxies we have found that the far-infrared (FIR, 40-120-mu-m) luminosities and the near-infrared (J, H, K, 1.25-2.2-mu-m) luminosities are correlated. The average value of log (L(FIR)/L(H)) equals 0.5 +/- 0.2. To explain this correlation we suggest that the minisurvey galaxies are presently in a phase of enhanced star formation (experiencing a starburst). The far-infrared luminosity is due to dust heated by young massive stars and the near-infrared luminosity is dominated by evolved massive red giants and supergiants (M greater-than-or-similar-to 3 M.). The correlation then implies that the period of enhanced star formation lasts at least as long as the time of massive stars to evolve to red supergiants, about 15 million years. To investigate quantitatively the initial star formation rate and the age of the starburst we have developed a simple model to calculate the near- and far-infrared luminosity in an exponentially decaying burst of star formation. This model successfully reproduces the evolution of the near-infrared colours of star clusters in the Magellanic Clouds. Adopting burst decay times of 20, 100 and 500 Myr, we have constructed models that reproduce the observed L(FIR)/L(H) luminosity ratio at average burst ages of 30, 110 and 400 Myr, respectively. These models can be made to fit the observations only when a large fraction of the bolometric luminosity generated in the starburst is emitted outside the IRAS bands, longward of 120-mu-m. This leads us to the introduction of two dust components, a warm component with a dust temperature of 60 K and a cool component with dust temperatures in the range 15-21 K. Both dust components are predominantly heated by hot luminous stars produced in the starburst. In starbursts younger than about 100 Myr the near-infrared radiation is dominated by supergiants (M greater-than-or-similar-to 8 M.) while in older starbursts the dominant contribution comes from red giants and AGB stars (3 greater-than-or-similar-to M/ M. greater-than-or-similar-to 8). We have attempted to derive initial star formation rates in the starburst by comparing our models with the observations. The results depend critically on the adopted lower limit of the mass spectrum of stars at birth (the initial mass function). Adopting a lower mass limit m1 = 1 M. we need initial star formation rates ranging from 4-120 M. yr-1 for tau-B = 20 Myr to 1-30 M. yr-1 for tau-B = 500 Myr, to explain the observed H-band luminosities of the minisurvey galaxies. For the preferred burst decay time tau-B = 100 Myr initial star formation rates of 2-60 M. yr-1 are implied. We show that due to the large extinction in star formation regions (A(B) approximately 3) the optical light of the minisurvey galaxies is dominated by older stars, not produced in the present starburst. This explains why L(FIR) and L(B) are much more poorly correlated than L(FIR) and L(NIR). The fact that the near-infrared radiation of actively star forming galaxies is dominated by recently formed massive red giants and supergiants has implications for the interpretation of the near-infrared Tully-Fisher relation.

AB We have analyzed IRAS maps at 60 and 100-mu-m of the complex of dark clouds containing L134, L183 and L1780.  Regions were found that are bright at 100-mu-m but not detected at 60-mu-m.  These regions exhibit high optical opacities and are associated with the dark clouds.  The 60-mu-m surface brightness is observed to decline in a narrow transition layer surrounding the cloud centers.  In the outer environs the ratio I60/I100 has a nearly constant value of 0.2.  The absence of 60-mu-m emission yields an upper limit of 15 K for the temperature of the dust, assuming lambda-1 dust emissivity.  We have mapped the 60-mu-m deficient regions using the quantity DELTA-I100 = I100 - I60/Kelvin, where Kelvin is the ratio I60/I100 in the outer diffuse regions.  We have found a linear correlation between DELTA-I100 and both (CO)-C-13 column density and blue extinction.  The analysis suggests that the diffuse component of the cloud has been subtracted when constructing DELTA-I100, and that DELTA-I100 is tightly correlated with molecular material with densities in excess of n(H-2) = 10(3).  We have derived an upper limit for the mass absorption coefficient of dust at 100-mu-m of 4.8 g cm-2. This limit is consistent with earlier determinations.  The sudden drop in the 60-mu-m emission can only be explained when assuming a separate grain component at 60-mu-m that undergoes a change in properties in a narrow transition region.  We infer that condensation of a thin mantle on the grains in the transition layer can explain the observed infrared properties.

AB We report 1" resolution imaging of 2-mu-m H I Br-gamma and H-2 1-0 S(1) line emission toward the nucleus of the Seyfert 2 galaxy NGC 1068.  The data, taken with a new imaging Fabry-Perot, show that the emission in both infrared lines originates from within 2" (170 pc) of the peak of radio, near-infrared, and visible continuum radiation.  The vibrational H-2 emission has a double-lobed shape, with a minimum toward the nucleus and two peaks about 1.3" on either side of the nucleus along position angle 70-degrees east of north.  In contrast, the Br-gamma emission is peaked on the nucleus, similar to the central radio continuum structure and the narrow-line region (NLR) in the visible.  The Br-gamma emission has a almost-equal-to 1" (FWHM) diameter and is more compact than the distributions of visible NLR tracers. The H-2 emission is probably produced in hot gas with mass a few 10(3) M..  However, the total H-2 mass in the circumnuclear region hydrogen may approach 10(8) M..  The H-2 emission is not produced in a 1 pc size obscuring torus but probably comes from a system of molecular clouds in the vicinity of the NLR.  The molecular clouds probably contribute significantly to the extinction of the nuclear source. We propose that the circumnuclear Br-gamma and H-2 emission lines are excited in gas heated by UV or X-ray photons emitted by a central nonstellar source.

AB We investigate the characteristics of the interstellar medium and massive star formation in the lenticular galaxy NGC 5195 and adjacent and overlying parts of the Whirlpool spiral (M51, NGC 5194) via broad-band red and Ha imaging. Although NGC 5195 has a moderate amount of interstellar gas, we find no visual line emission that is unambiguously associated with star formation in this galaxy. We use our R (0.65-mu-m) and I (0.8-mu-m) images to derive a map of the obscuring dust distribution toward this galaxy. We find good agreement between the distribution of the obscuration and published 21-cm H I maps. Our estimate of A(V)/N(H I) toward NGC 5195 is in fair agreement with that found for the Milky Way. From our map of the dust extinction, we correct our observed red image to reveal the unobscured stellar light distribution. The resultant image looks like a nearly normal SO galaxy, but with a faint bar-like structure and ring. Our H-alpha image also includes most of the northern half of the spiral, which allows us to investigate star formation where the galaxies have apparently sideswiped each other. We identify about 100 individual H II regions in our image, from which we derive the H II region luminosity functions (LFs) for the pair of northern spiral arms. We find that there is no obvious variation in this function with position along or across the arms nor between this portion of M51 and the entire galaxy, although the LF for the two arms is different. We propose that the shape of the high-luminosity end of the H II region LF in galaxies is determined largely by the mass function of the molecular clouds.

TI GEOCHEMICAL EVIDENCE FOR A CATASTROPHIC BIOTIC EVENT AT THE FRASNIAN FAMENNIAN BOUNDARY IN SOUTH CHINA
SO GEOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
ID cretaceous-tertiary boundary; mass-extinction horizon; impact
AB A strong delta-C-13 anomaly coincides with a weak Ir anomaly at the Frasnian/Famennian (F/F) boundary exposed at Xiangtian, Guangxi, south China.  The maximum whole-rock Ir abundance is 0.23 ppb (0.35 ppb on a carbonate-free basis) compared with averages of 0.016 and 0.044 ppb above and below the boundary interval.  The delta-C-13 in carbonate abruptly shifts from a late Frasnian level of about +1 parts per thousand to -2.49 parts per thousand in the boundary interval and then abruptly returns to pre-boundary levels, suggesting a temporary reduction of surface-water biomass.  A widely distributed (over at least several hundred kilometres) limestone breccia unit of possible wave-deposit origin is present directly below the boundary in south China.  Enrichments of Al, V, Cr, As, and U, and a dip in the Mn abundance in the boundary interval indicate that reducing conditions might have been associated with the element enrichment.  However, an alternative hypothesis is that oceanic impact(s) at the F/F boundary near south China provided the excess Ir and caused the biotic crisis and the formation of breccia deposits observed in the Late Devonian South China Sea.

TI A SELF-REGULATED STATE FOR THE INTERSTELLAR-MEDIUM - RADIAL DEPENDENCE IN THE GALACTIC PLANE

AB The radial dependence in the galactic plane of the star formation rate (SFR) and the value of various variables related to the state of the interstellar medium are calculated assuming that two regulating mechanisms act simultaneously; that is: the "heating regulated warm gas condensation" (HRWGC), that acts as a large scale self-regulating mechanism of star formation, and the "photoionization-regulated star formation" (PIRSF) that acts at the scale of single molecular clouds but depends on the ambient conditions. The two regulating mechanisms are linked via the far UV interstellar radiation field (FUV-ISRF) which dominates the heating of the warm interstellar gas and the ionization in the bulk of the mass of molecular clouds. Since the FUV-ISRF is determined by the large scale distribution of massive stars, in this model the state of the warm gas and molecular clouds are related with the recent SFR. The simultaneous action of the two mechanisms tends to maintain the SFR near an equilibrium value due to the fact that when the SFR is higher (lower) than a critical value then both, the rate of condensation of warm gas and the star formation efficiency in molecular clouds are reduced (increased). The HRWGC mechanism controls the SFR at large scale; the PIRSF mechanism assures a fast response of the system to departures from the equilibrium. Given the radial dependence of the gas metallicity, the primary cosmic ray ionization rate, and the warm gas density, the HRWGC assumption permits to calculate the radial dependence of the FUV-ISRF, the formation rate of massive stars, the thermal pressure, and the temperature and fractional ionization of the warm gas and of the cores of the recently formed small neutral clouds. The PIRSF assumption permits to calculate the mass of the molecular gas in active star forming regions that is compatible with the equilibrium SFR. The mass distribution in the molecular phase is calculated assuming that the clouds have the equilibrium visual extinction corresponding to the state of dynamical equilibrium. The resulting equilibrium states compare reasonably well with the observations for galactocentric distances greater than 7 kpc, but for lower galactocentric distances there is a tendency of discrepancy. This discrepancy might be explained in terms of a saturation of the HRWGC mechanism. That is: the mass in the diffuse phases is insufficient to supply the net consumption of the star formation process at the equilibrium rate. In these saturated regions the SFR is lower than the equilibrium rate and the highest possible fraction of molecular gas is expected because the warm gas does not reach thermal equilibrium. Probably this is the final SFR regime in evolved galaxies without extragalactic gas input.

AB Much disagreement over the interpretation of data bearing on various Cretaceous/Tertiary (K/T) extinction scenarios results from a failure to view these data within their appropriate stratigraphic context.  Combined biostratigraphic and chronostratigraphic analyses of K/T boundary sequences have revealed systematic differences in patterns of sediment accumulation within continental-shelf and deep-sea depositional settings.  Although virtually all deep-sea boundary sequences are marked by intervals of nondeposition or hiatus formation during the latest Cretaceous and earliest Tertiary, many continental shelf-slope sequences appear to be temporally complete over this same interval.  This differential pattern of sediment accumulation can be related to the latest Maastrichtian-earliest Danian sea-level rise, during which deep-sea sediment-accumulation rates would be expected to drop as the locus of sediment deposition migrated across the continental shelf.  Our data suggest that the abrupt shifts in carbon-isotope abundances, single-peak Ir anomalies, and apparently instantaneous mass extinctions of marine plankton-which are routinely reported from deep-sea K/T boundary sequences and used to support a causal relation between Late Cretaceous bolide impacts and K/T mass extinctions-may be artifacts of a temporally incomplete (or extremely condensed) deep-sea stratigraphic record.

TI RADIAL-VELOCITY DISTRIBUTION AND LINE STRENGTHS OF 33 CARBON STARS IN THE GALACTIC BULGE

AB We report radial velocities and spectroscopy for the 33 carbon stars discovered by Azzopardi, Lequeux, and Rebeirot in low-extinction windows to the Galactic bulge along l = 0-degrees. We find the velocity dispersion to be 113 +/- 14 km s-1 and the mean to be -44 +/- 20 km s-1, consistent with the kinematics of bulge K and M giants. The bulge carbon stars have several properties in common with classical early R stars: nineteen show enhanced C-13, and all 33 are too faint to be on the AGB (M(bol) > - 2.5). In contrast to local early R stars and CH stars in omega-Cen, however, the bulge carbon stars have much stronger NaD and CN absorption. This absorption exhibits a gradient in latitude with the stars with the strongest lines near the Galactic center. We propose that this is caused by a gradient in metallicity with is consistent with what is inferred from bulge color-magnitude diagrams and the properties of M giants. If the bulge carbon stars are genuine early R stars, then the inferred high abundance poses further difficulties for current theories of carbon star formation.

AB We have compared the large-scale distributions of Galactic infrared and H I emission towards the Magellanic Clouds, resulting in estimates of the infrared foreground of the Clouds. For the Galactic gas-to-dust ration by mass we find 420 (+250, -120). From H I maps, we have also derived maps of the Galactic foreground colour excess towards the Magellanic Clouds on scales of 48 arcmin. Over the LMC surface the foreground reddening is not constant; it ranges from E(B - V) = 0.07 to 0.17 mag. For the SMC we find a foreground reddening E(B - V) = 0.07 to 0.09 mag. The amplitude of foreground reddening variations is probably much greater on smaller scales. Towards the 30 Doradus region, the mean foreground reddening is quite low. As a result, differences between the 30 Doradus and the average LMC extinction curves are much less than previously suggested.

AB Habitat patches have been compared to oceanic islands, land-bridge islands, or continental land masses on the basis of inferences about interpatch movements drawn from distribution patterns. This study presents data on movements of Columbian ground squirrels (Spermophilus columbianus (Ord)) within and between patches of uncultivated habitat. Although squirrels moved between habitat patches, colonization of new habitats did not occur, because emigrants settled near other squirrels rather than in vacant patches. Patch occupancy was related to distance from a source of squirrels but not to area. Because of low colonization rates, ground squirrels may decline dramatically in agricultural regions where they are confined to patchy habitats if patches lose populations through extinction.

AB Planktonic foraminiferal extinctions at Caravaca and Agost occurred over an extended time period similar to El Kef and Brazos River.  Some species disappeared well below the boundary.  About 39-45% of the species, but less than 15% of the individuals in the population, became extinct at or near the K/T boundary.  A second phase of extinction occurred at the top of the boundary clay (P0/Pla) and the remaining Cretaceous species (except G. cretacea) disappeared in Subzone Pla.  Species extinctions were selective eliminating geographically restricted large, complex and deeper dwelling forms first and favoring survival of cosmopolitan small, simple surface dwellers.  Only surface dwellers survived the K/T boundary event, whereas all deeper dwelling species, as well as some surface dwellers, disappeared at the boundary. We interprete the selective abundance decline during the latest Cretaceous as a result of the seal level regression that reached a maximum just prior to the K/T boundary.  The highly selective nature of the two-phased species extinctions at and above the boundary, we believe to be related to the major reduction in surface productivity and the breakdown in the water mass stratification that was associated with the rapid sea level transgression across the K/T boundary.  A bolide impact however, may have hastened the demise of an already declining Cretaceous fauna.

AB The stratospheric aerosol layer has been investigated by ground based backscatter lidar at Garmisch-Partenkirchen since 1976.  A conversion of particle backscatter to particle extinction, mass and surface area via an aerosol model allows to study climatic implications of volcanic events and heterogeneous chemistry effects on the stratospheric ozone layer.  The observations show that a volcanically perturbed period lasting from 1979 until 1986 was preceeded and followed by volcanically quiescent periods.  A comparison of these two background periods reveals enhanced backscattering in 1989/90 with respect to the 1977/79 level.  A comparison of IFU aerosol data with ozone data obtained by the German Weather Service at Hohenpeissenberg through balloon soundings indicates an anticorrelation during the maximum of the volcanic perturbation in 1982/83 following the E1 Chichon eruption of April 1982.

ID raman-scattering; laminar; methane
AB Simultaneous Raman-Rayleigh-fluoresence measurements have been made in turbulent jet diffusion flames of CO/CH4/N2 and CO/H2/N2 fuel mixtures.  Species mass fractions of CO, CO2, CH4, H-2, H2O, O2 and N2 are obtained from the Raman data, density and temperature from the Rayleigh data, and the OH radical from the laser-induced fluorescence measurements.  The fairly high N2 dilution, by suppressing chemiluminescence interference, results in improved quality Raman data.  The extinction behavior of all the flames tested is qualitatively similar to that of diluted flames of CH4:  as the jet velocity is increased, extinguished parcels appear more and more frequently in the region of highest mixing rates, until finally reaction downstream of this region is no longer sustained.  For the CO/CH4/N2 flames extinction occurs throughout the reactive zone, whilst for the CO/H-2/N2 flame, extinction is seen mainly on the lean side of stoichiometric composition.  One effect of CH4 admixture is to narrow the reaction zone on the rich side through radical depletion by the fuel.  As expected, it is found that the CO-CO2 conversion is far from being in partial equilibrium in these flames.

AB The intrinsic mid-infrared optical absorption of a ZrF4-BaF2-LaF3-AlF3-NaF (ZBLAN) glass has been determined by combining laser calorimetry and spark-source mass spectrographic analysis. The total optical absorption of four samples of varying purity was measured at 3.9-mu-m with laser calorimetry. The extrinsic contribution to the total absorption for each glass was calculated from the measured concentration of rare-earth impurity ions and known extinction coefficients.  The intrinsic absorption of this glass at 3.9-mu-m determined from the difference between the total measured absorption and the calculated extrinsic absorption is 6.11 (+/- 0.61) X 10(-4) cm-1.

AB Collision of comets and asteroids appears to be a forceful mechanism as an alternative to volcanism for creating stress on life on the earth but a general theory of mass extinctions over geologic ages is difficult to formulate from the meagre observations available so far.

AB Low resolution IUE UV and optical observations are presented of HD 269216, the visually brightest member of the LH 39 association in the LMC. Although the UV and optical line spectra are broadly consistent with a B8 Ia spectral type for HD 269216, the classification is complicated by several discrepancies. The observed UV continuum flux distribution is much shallower than evident for "normal" late B supergiants, with no pronounced Balmer jump observed in HD 269216. Broad emission lines of hydrogen, with for example a FWHM of H-beta approximately 650 km s-1, and possible HeI emission are peculiarities in the optical spectrum. We estimate a stellar luminosity log (L*/L.) approximately 5.4, which places HD 269216 in the same location in the H-R diagram as R71 in minimum state. The two stars are compared, and we suggest that HD 269216 warrants further monitoring as a possible S Dor-type variable.

TI MASS MORTALITY AND EXTINCTION IN A HIGH-ELEVATION POPULATION OF RANA-MUSCOSA
SO JOURNAL OF HERPETOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
ID predation
AB Rana muscosa is one of several high-elevation amphibians that have recently disappeared from seemingly pristine sites.  The present study documents an event of mass mortality among larval and metamorphosed R. muscosa in a lake in Kings Canyon National Park, California, and the ultimate extinction of the population.  In 1979 metamorphosed individuals declined from ca. 800 individuals in early summer to nearly zero in late summer.  During this time many carcasses were collected, individuals showed symptoms of red-leg disease, and blood from an affected individual contained the bacterial pathogen characteristic of this disease, Aeromonas hydrophila.  Also during the summer of 1979, nearly all of the approximately 1100 tadpoles began metamorphosis, but all metamorphosing individuals were consumed by Brewer's blackbirds (Euphagus cyanocephalus).  This population of R. muscosa continued to exist until at least 1983, but was extinct by 1989.  Recolonization of the site will probably never occur because streams connecting to extant populations of R. muscosa now contain introduced fishes.

AB The evolution of bare spherical dust grains in the halo of spiral galaxies is analyzed.  Two different grain compounds, graphites and astronomical silicates, are considered.  The detailed mass and luminosity distributions for the Milky Way and NGC 3198 (considered as representative of the Sb and Sc types, respectively) are used to evaluate the range of possible evolutionary tracks.  Aside from radiative and gravitational forces, the effects of drag and sputtering from a gaseous halo are included.  A simple isothermal and hydrostatic density structure, with temperatures in the range 3 x 10(5) - 10(6) K, has been used for this gaseous halo.  Most results depend on the optical properties of dust compounds (or, equivalently, on the radiation pressure coefficients) because the velocities define the final fate of the grains (i.e., destruction in the halo or expulsion from host galaxy).  Graphites move faster than silicates, but both types of grains can reach values in excess of 10(2) km s-1.  The efficiency for grain destruction increases with (a) increasing halo gas temperature, (b) decreasing galaxy mass, and (c) decreasing radiation pressure coefficients.  Thus, silicates behave as a "fragile" grain population in low mass galaxies with a hot (T approximately 10(6) K) corona.  For a central halo gas density of 0.1 cm-3, spherical silicates with an initial radius of a = 10(-5) cm lose almost 20% of their mass in time scales between 10(8) and 2 x 10(8) yr.  Some effects of a poloidal magnetic field are also explored along with possible consequences on halo metallicities and intergalactic dust.  Grain expulsion can be a common phenomenon in spirals.

AB Spatial variability in availability of resources that limit photosynthesis (water and N) leads to variation in rates of atmosphere-biosphere exchange.  N content and allocation are canopy properties that link ecosystem, physiological, and biophysical processes and that vary in space at scales relevant to atmosphere-biosphere interaction.  We studied landscape-scale variation in these and related canopy properties in Kansas Tallgrass Prairie (USA).  The tallgrass ecosystem was suited to this investigation because primary production in the prairie is constrained by N availability.  This work was designed to aid in interpretation and spatial extrapolation of gas exchange measurements made using aerodynamic techniques as part of FIFE (First ISLSCP Field Experiment), a NASA-supported study.  We collected data on spatial distribution of biomass, leaf area index (LAI), canopy N mass, N concentration ([N]), and gas exchange along topographic and management gradients.  We also measured height distribution of N, light interception, and gas exchange within canopies as a function of position in the landscape.  Substantial variation in biomass, LAI, N accumulation, and N allocation occurred over time, with topography, and as a result of previous burning.  The vertical gradient of [N] and photosynthetic capacity within canopies were correlated, in space and time, with biomass and canopy light interception.  The gradients were steeper in high biomass sites than in low biomass sites.  In addition, proportional N allocation to the upper layer increased with time (12% in June, 32% in August) as biomass increased.  As nutrient uptake increased within the tallgrass landscape, biomass increased and light limitation in the lower canopy was induced.  As this light limitation increased with increasing biomass, or with accumulation of dead vegetation, allocation of N to the upper canopy increased.  Height distribution of photosynthetic capacity paralleled within-canopy N allocation and light interception.  As resource ratios (light, water, and nitrogen) varied in the landscape, so did rates of gas exchange.  This work suggests that interactions between light extinction, N allocation, and photosynthesis that have been proposed for monospecific stands apply to the multispecies, but structurally simple, canopy of the tallgrass prairie.  Models of plant performance based on evolutionary arguments may provide a powerful basis for spatial extrapolation of atmosphere-ecosystem exchange rates from sites to landscapes and larger regions.

AB We report measurements of isotopic CO line emission and J, H, K near-infrared  continuum emission of the barred spiral NGC 6764.  The optical, near-infrared, and millimeter data are in excellent agreement with a brief and intense starburst at the nucleus.  This finding is supported by the Wolf-Rayet emission-line features seen in the nucleus of the galaxy which are direct evidence for recent massive star formation.  Toward the nucleus the molecular interstellar medium is moderately warm and dense. Simple, one-component model calculations of radiative transfer show that the minimum beam-averaged temperature of the gas is of the order of 20 K, and that the molecular hydrogen density ranges between 3 x 10(3) and 3 x 10(4) cm-3.  In the arms the molecular gas is either subthermally excited, and/or the kinetic temperature is less than 10 K.  The ratio between far-infrared (FIR) luminosity and molecular hydrogen masses is in the range of values expected for noninteracting starburst galaxies.  Comparing the morphologies of the near-infrared continuum and (CO)-C-12 line emission, we find that most of the molecular gas is associated with a massive, barlike, nuclear stellar bulge.  The near-infrared colors of the spiral bar are in agreement with colors expected for late-type stars and Sc galaxies.  Applying the beam-averaged molecular column density, we estimate an extinction of A(v) = 3-4 mag toward the nucleus.  The dereddened nuclear colors are indicative for a composite galactic nucleus resulting from significant contributions of both a power-law source and a stellar component. By comparing NGC 6764 to a starburst galaxy, elliptical radio galaxy, Seyfert galaxy, and a quasar, we conclude that, judged from the two lowest rotational levels of CO, these sources show common beam-averaged properties of the molecular gas:  the bulk of the nuclear molecular line emission arises in warm, dense, optically thick gas.  The CO line emission in the disks and arms of the galaxies arises from cold and probably subthermally excited gas.

AB We present far-infrared and submillimeter images of five bright visual reflection nebulae, IC 446, NGC 2247, NGC 2245, NGC 7023, and CED 201 at wavelengths of 100, 160, and 200 or 370-mu-m obtained with cameras designed for NASA's Kuiper Airborne Observatory and the Infrared Telescope Facility. We supplement our results at wavelengths of 12, 25, 60, and 100-mu-m with data from the Infrared Astronomical Satellite. We use our images and composite infrared spectra to derive parameters such as the fraction of nebular emission attributed to molecule-sized grains, the range of nebular grain albedos, gas densities, and gas cloud geometries consistent with near-infrared-to-submillimeter observations, and the relative extinction efficiency Q(ext)(UV)/Q(em)(FIR) and the resultant mass-extinction coefficient chi-ext(FIR) consistent with observed equilibrium grain temperatures and inferred ambient radiative energy densities. We compare our observations with models of nebular far-infrared emission assuming large grains heated by photospheres characteristic of the central exciting stars. Our results show that 30%-45% of the nebular emission lies at wavelengths of lambda < 30-mu-m (emission attributed to an abundance of molecule-sized grains). Among our nebulae, the variation in infrared luminosity may be related to variations in nebular gas density and less than optimal gas cloud geometries rather than to anomalous grain albedos. For stellar photospheres with effective wavelengths of lambda-mean almost-equal-to 0.25-0.5-mu-m, we infer from our observations relative extinction efficiencies of Q(ext)(UV)/Q(em)(250-mu-m) almost-equal-to 1000-5000. Accounting for the extinction of molecule-sized grains, the resultant mass-extinction coefficient is chi-ext(250-mu-m) almost-equal-to 10-50 cm2 g-1. In comparison, models of nebular grain emission require Q(ext)(UV)/Q(em)(250-mu-m) almost-equal-to 8000(0.5-mu-m/lambda-mean) and chi-ext(250-mu-m) almost-equal-to 5-6 cm2 g-1. Radiative transfer models illustrate the variation in far-infrared surface brightness with nebular gas density and the apparent reduction in far-infrared optical depth associated with line-of-sight gradients in nebular radiative energy density.

AB In the present paper 124 galaxies of all morphological types members of the Virgo cluster are studied via accurate near infrared JHK photometry. Apparent fixed aperture magnitudes and colors, corrected for galactic extinction and redshift, for a sample of early-type galaxies are used to construct color-color (J - H) vs. (H - K) diagrams. Color-magnitude (J - H), (H - K), (J - K) and (V - K) versus K(T) diagrams are established for the galaxies with measured diameters in our sample. The (J - K) and (V - K) versus K(T) diagrams show a color-luminosity relationship. From published velocity dispersion data and the IR luminosities for 26 early-type galaxies the L - sigma and L - sigma - I(e) relationships are investigated for IR wavelengths and compared with similar relationships in other bands. Our results are the following: (i) As previously found for the early-type galaxies in the Coma cluster, the L is-proportional-to sigma-n relationship presents systematic slope variations that depend on the wavelength of the photometric bandpass from which L is inferred, the power n increasing towards longer wavelengths. (ii) The relationship for the Virgo galaxies with log sigma < 2.0 shows a significantly smaller value of the velocity dispersion exponent for both the optical and IR bands, as compared with the corresponding values found in Coma. (iii) The L(K) is-proportional-to sigma-n and L(K) is-proportional-to sigma-alpha-I(e)-beta relationships in our sample, yield exponent values n and alpha smaller than those found for the Coma cluster, while the values of beta are similar for both clusters. The differences in slope of the L - sigma-relationships in Virgo as compared to Coma, are to be interpreted in terms of either: (a) an increase of the fraction of kinetic energy invested in rotation for the galaxies in the Virgo cluster with respect to Coma, or (b) a difference in the stellar content of the galaxies in the clusters; or a combination of both effects, and finally (iv) the mass-to-light ration (M/L) for the early-type galaxies in Virgo presents a stronger dependence on total luminosity than their counterparts in Coma.

AB A numerical model of meterology, aerosols, and radiative transfer is used to study the impact of a large forest fire smoke plume on atmospheric processes. The simulated smoke optical depths at 0.63-mu-m wavelength are in agreement with analyses of satellite data and show values as high as 1.8. The smoke has an albedo of 35%, or more than double the clear-sky value, and cools the surface by as much as 5 K. The best agreement with the analyses of optical depth and surface cooling is obtained when a fuel loading more than 10 times that which has been previously suggested is used to calculate the initial smoke mass load. An imaginary refractive index, n(im), of 0.01 yields results which closely match the observed cooling, single scattering albedo, and the Angstrom wavelength exponent. An n(im) of 0.1, typical of smoke from urban fires, produces 9 K cooling. Coagulation causes the geometric mean radius by number to increase from the initial value of 0.08-mu-m to a final value of 0.15-mu-m while the specific extinction and absorption increase by 40% and 25%, respectively. After 42 hours, these changes in the smoke optical properties lead to a 32% increase in optical depth and an 11% increase in surface cooling over that found in a simulation where coagulation is not allowed. In the model, 47% of the smoke is removed by scavenging as it is incorporated into the frontal zone over the Great Lakes. Self-lofting of the smoke in a direct, smoke-induced circulation is observed in the baseline simulation and is much stronger in the urban smoke simulation.

AB Results of an H-alpha + [N II] narrowband imaging survey of x-ray-selected E and SO galaxies are presented. A new technique is described for objectively optimizing removal of stellar continuum light while providing well-defined estimates of systematic errors. The procedure has the additional benefit of eliminating sky contamination specifically in image regions occupied by galaxy light. Detailed consideration of the measured spectral energy distributions is included in the flux calibration procedure, and emission-line luminosities (or upper limits), corrected for Galactic foreground extinction, are tabulated for metric apertures. The resulting luminosities for the sample members show no tendency to correlate with x-ray luminosities. Observed H-alpha + [N II] luminosity (L(H-alpha + [N II])) does correlate with far-infrared luminosity (L(FIR)), with typical ratios of L(H-alpha + [N II])/L(FIR) that are an order of magnitude below those for late type galaxies. Some tendency is found for L(H-alpha + [N II]) to correlate with nonthermal radio power, thought this may be due to eccentricities of the sample selection. No connection is apparent between the "boxiness" or "diskiness" of stellar isophotes and emission-line or far-infrared luminosity. Optical nebulosity in early type galaxies probably contains a significant multiparameter dependence on active galactic nuclei behavior, accretion from the hot interstellar medium, and mass injection from external sources. Emission associated with cooling flow phenomena on a galaxy scale may be overwhelmed in many instances by other sources of mass and ionization, suggesting that analogies between nebulosity in these sources and emission in cluster cooling-flow galaxies should be treated with caution.

AB We present a set of simultaneous high-resolution spectroscopic and spectrophotometric observations of 22 K7-M1 T Tauri stars in the Taurus-Auriga dark cloud.  Analysis of the high-resolution data makes it possible to separate the optical excess ("veiling") emission from the photospheric fluxes in these stars.  The amount of optical excess emission at 5500 angstrom ranges from undetectable (less-than-or-similar-to 10% of the photosphere) to as much as 10 times the photospheric flux in the most extreme objects.  We use the spectrophotometry to derive improved reddening corrections and determine the spectral energy distributions of the excess emission between 3500 and 8400 angstrom.  Spectra of the excesses are flat in F-lambda or rise slowly toward the blue at optical wavelengths, and most objects have a Balmer emission jump.  The optical excess emission can contribute significantly to the total flux in both the V and R passbands, and the excesses have caused previous estimates of the visual extinction to be as much as 50% too low for several T Tauri stars.  New values for the stellar luminosities of the program objects do not differ significantly from those obtained from near-infrared studies. Simple models indicate that the optical excesses arise from regions with densities approximately 10(14) cm-3, temperatures of approximately 9000 K, optical depths between approximately 0.2 and 5, and covering factors of approximately 5% of the stellar surface area.  The mass accretion rates inferred from the excesses are typically approximately 10(-7) M. yr-1.  Disk models for the near-infrared excesses indicate that accretion energy and reprocessed light from the central star contribute roughly equally to the near-infrared excesses of objects with moderate optical excesses.  Our observations are consistent with the idea that optical excess emission in T Tauri stars comes from the boundary layer of an accretion disk.

TI BIOTIC EFFECTS OF SEA-LEVEL CHANGE - THE PLEISTOCENE TEST
SO JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SOLID EARTH AND PLANETS
LA English
DT Article
ID mass extinction; fossil record; faunal diversity; model; boundary; patterns; biology; events; curves
AB Species diversity change, and therefore compositional changes in a biota, may be associated with changes at any of three ecological levels, involving the number of provinces within the biosphere, of communities within provinces, and of species represented within communities.  Pleistocene sea level changes did not much affect the marine biosphere at any ecological level.  An analysis of an extensive data set of Californian Pleistocene and Recent mollusks indicates a continuity of community and species composition during highstands of the last million years.  Extensive latitudinal shifts in species' geographic ranges, associated with climatic change and not with sea level itself, created the most significant biotic changes.  Extinctions were minimal, well below predicted species-area effects.  Evidently, only "perched" faunas are particularly vulnerable to sea level change.  Although sea level falls are commonly associated with a faunal hiatus, changes associated therewith can be referred to sea level change itself only in limited situations, and other paleobiologic explanations should be sought in most cases.

AB The current state of our understanding of mantle plumes and their effect on other features within and on the Earth is reviewed.  The physical conditions necessary for the existence of plumes, i.e., narrow vertically oriented cylinders of reduced viscosity and density, are discussed and it is argued that these conditions occur within the mantle.  Heat is believed to provide the reduction in viscosity, via thermally activated creep, and the reduction in density, via normal thermal expansion, although metasomatic plumes could occur.  The heat for the plumes probably originates with the core.  Theoretical and experimental models of plume structure and of plume initiation are reviewed, with special attention paid to the possibility of solitary waves propagating up the plume conduit.  The suggestion that impacts of extraterrestrial bodies could initiate plumes is critically investigated and found to be implausible.  Possible ways that plumes can interact with general mantle convection are reviewed.

TI UVBY AND JHKL' PHOTOMETRY OF OB STARS IN THE ASSOCIATION CYGNUS OB2

AB We have obtained uvby and JHK photometry of about 80 stars in the association Cygnus OB2 (VI Cygni), including some foreground stars and three infrared sources.  We present colour-colour and colour-magnitude diagrams from which we derive the interstellar extinction and approximate spectral types.  We confirm that the interstellar extinction law in the direction of Cyg OB2 is similar to the galactic mean.  The ratio of total-to-selective extinction is found to be R(v) = 3.04 +/- 0.09.  We derive a true distance modulus of V(o) - M(v) = 11.2 +/- 0.2, corresponding to d = 1.7 +/- 0.2 kpc.  The majority of the stars are still on the main sequence; we estimate a minimum age of 3 Myr for the association.  Only two stars in our sample show significant infrared excesses at lambda greater-than-or-equal-to 2.2-mu-m.

TI PARTICLE-SIZE ANALYSIS WITH A DISK CENTRIFUGE - IMPORTANCE OF THE EXTINCTION EFFICIENCY
SO ACS SYMPOSIUM SERIES
LA English
DT Article
AB Comparison of standard samples is made between mass distributions obtained gravimetrically and those obtained from a disc centrifuge photosedimentometer with full extinction efficiency corrections. The excellent agreement between theory and experiment suggests that accurate results are readily obtainable for many types of materials. Some form of light scattering is used in most particle sizers. For particles less than a few microns in size light scattering corrections are necessary to obtain accurate size distribution information. Calculations of the full extinction efficiencies for correcting turbidity data obtained with a broad spectrum source are reviewed. Examples for carbon black, quartz powder, and polystyrene latex are given.

TI MEASUREMENTS OF THE OPTICAL-CONSTANTS OF SOLID AND MOLTEN GOLD AND TIN AT LAMBDA = 10.6 MU-M
SO JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS
LA English
DT Article
ID metals
AB The index of refraction, the extinction coefficient, and the absorptance for gold and tin were measured in a temperature range from room temperature up to the melting point for the wavelength lambda = 10.6-mu-m.  All measurements were performed under ultrahigh-vacuum conditions using a photometric infrared ellipsometer with a rotating analyzer.  Measurements verify a discontinuous jump of the absorptance at the solid-to-liquid phase transition from 3.5 to 6.5% in the case of gold and from 4.9 to 9.2% in the case of tin.  The experimental results derived for the clean solid surface are in good agreement with the theoretical prediction by a Drude model, if additionally appropriate effective masses and the anomalous skin effect are taken into account.  This theory is much less accurate if applied to the molten state of gold and tin, as was already shown previously for liquid aluminum and copper.

AB In this paper we model the process of taxonomic evolution as a Galton-Watson branching process in discrete time and, using maximum likelihood, develop methods to estimate the probabilities of origination, persistence, and extinction of fossil taxa.  We use the methods to estimate the probabilities of origination, persistence, and extinction of families (1) within 135 orders of marine invertebrate organisms, (2) within 12 phyla, and (3) within all marine invertebrate life (independently of the suprafamilial classification). Most orders, including the arcoid bivalves, the dentaloid scaphopods, the orders of chitins, and many others, have relatively low probabilities of familial origination and extinction.  The various ammonoid and trilobite orders, and some others, have high probabilities of origination and extinction.  Among the phyla, the Archaeocyatha have the highest probabilities of familial origination and extinction, and the Annelida the lowest, with the more typical phyla of shelly organisms clustering near the high end of the probability scale.  The Porifera and Protozoa also have low probabilities but not as low as the Annelida.  The estimated origination and extinction probabilities for families within all marine invertebrate life are 0.470 and 0.452 per stage, respectively, values that are at the high end of the probability scale.  We have also estimated the probabilities of ultimate extinction (extinction of all families) of the supertaxa. By analyzing the changes of the diversity during each stratigraphic stage separately, we have also determined the trajectories of the estimated origination and extinction probabilities for families also determined the trajectories of the estimated origination and extinction probabilities for families within all marine invertebrate life.  The estimated origination probability is relatively high in association with the expansion of the Cambrian and Paleozoic evolutionary faunas and declines to more normal levels for the remainder of the Phanerozoic.  The trajectory of the estimated extinction probability is from nearly zero early in the Phanerozoic to more normal levels later, showing clearly defined peaks in association with the five Phanerozoic mass-extinction events.  The terminal Cretaceous mass extinction is the only one of the five that was not preceded by a monotonic decline of origination probability or by a series of stages with low origination probability.  It appears to have been a unique, singular event. Because the mathematical theory we employ as a model corresponds so closely to the processes of taxonomic evolution as we understand them, we believe that the theory provides a reasonable model of biological reality.

ID desert dusts; drought; mass
AB The Saharan and Sahelian regions are a very important source of dust which amply contributes to the atmospheric dust load.  Till now, appropriate measurements on the mechanisms of wind erosion have been very scarce.  In 1984, a preliminary study allowed to investigate a possible relationship between the mineralogy of dust and that of surrounding soils along a North-South transect through the Sahara.  Three sites have been selected as possible dust province and, on each site, dust samples were collected by air pumping on a mast and soils were sampled as far as 10 or 20 kilometers from the mast.  Some available results of this work are given here.  In November 1989, a fourth site has been selected in the Sahel and a sophisticated apparatus has been used in order to study (1) the soils, the state of ground surface and the plant cover, (2) the roughness (3) the drag velocity (4) the turbulence, (5) the atmospheric dust load and dust composition (6) the wind velocity (7) the light extinction and (8) extrapolation by remote sensing (dust cloud, soils, vegetation cover and land use).

AB We present OH 1667-MHz observations covering the CrA dark cloud complex as well as HI 21-cm observations in a large region around the complex.  The OH profiles are of simple structure indicating the presence of only one component with a mean velocity V(OH) congruent-to +5.5 km s-1.  Three OH clumps are apparent, which are coincident with regions of high photographic extinction.  The gas to dust ratio derived from these observations is similar to the average value obtained for other dark clouds and shows that OH and dust are well mixed in the CrA dark cloud complex.  The total mass estimated for the molecular cloud amounts to M(T) congruent-to 7 x 10(3)M..  The HI observations show the well-known ridge of local gas of low positive velocities.  The accordance between the velocities of molecular and atomic gas in the region suggests that the molecular complex is embedded in the local HI-ridge.  We suggest that they both are related to Lindbald's feature A, i.e. to Gould's belt.

AB Five site-directed mutants of the N-terminal half-molecule of human serum transferrin have been expressed in baby hamster kidney cells and purified to homogeneity. Expression levels and overall yields varied considerably from the wild-type protein, depending on the mutant in question. The mutants are D63S, D63C, G65R, K206Q, and H207E and are based on mutations observed in a variety of transferrins of known sequence. Their molecular masses, determined by electrospray mass spectrometry, agree with theory, except for the D63C mutant, which appears to be cysteinylated. All mutants bind iron but with varying affinities; qualitatively, in increasing order D63S almost-equal-to D63C almost-equal-to G65R << wild type less-than-or-equal-to H207E <<K206Q. In general, reduction of formal negative charge within the binding cleft shifts the visible spectral maximum of the iron complex toward the blue and reduces the affinity for iron, and increasing the formal negative charge shifts the visible maximum toward the red and increases the affinity for iron. The K206Q mutant is exceptional inasmuch as its visible maximum shows a blue shift, but its affinity for iron is the greatest of all of the mutants studied. All mutants reported, in addition to the wild-type protein, exhibit very similar visible molar extinction coefficients for the iron complex and very similar changes in extinction coefficients at 240 nm on binding Fe(II() or Ga(III). These results suggest that in all cases the bound metal ion is coordinated by two tyrosyl side chains.

AB We present CO J = 1 --> 0 and J = 3 --> 2 mapping and spectroscopy of the post-main-sequence molecular outflow source NGC 7027. As a consequence, we find that the CO envelope has a deconvolved FWHM alpha x delta = 35 x 34 arcsecs2, whilst core CO profiles are shown to display a steep-sided, triple-peaked, and asymmetric configuration different from previous lower resolution results. The trends in line asymmetry are also reflected in spatial-velocity and velocity-channel maps, whence it is clear that lower velocity emission predominates to the SE, and higher velocity components to the NW. In contrast to this core behaviour, however, it is apparent that the overall shell structure is not tilted in the spatial-velocity plane, and the larger part of the outflow is probably well represented in terms of a spherically symmetric, constant velocity envelope. As a result of both these and previous measurements, we are able to construct a model in which H I outflow densities are enhanced within an "equatorial" disk-constraining expansion of the H II region, and resulting in the observed cylindrical ionised structure. Estimates of the associated extinction enable provisional mass estimates M(d) (H I) approximately 0.16 M. for the disk, and approximately 0.49 M. for the entire outflow zone, whilst enhanced disk densities are also invoked to explain the extremely large CO J = 3 --> 2 asymmetries. Finally, we discuss the probable further evolution of this source, and the likely formation of a bipolar configuration similar to NGC 6302.
