TI Primate evolution: a biology of holocene extinction and survival on the southeast
SO American journal of physical anthropology
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB What biological traits distinguish taxa susceptible to extinction from less  susceptible taxa? Substantiated island biogeographic theory suggests that after  insularization, small islands lose more species than do large islands. Thus,  susceptible taxa are those now found on only large islands. The traits of  susceptible taxa can thus be found by comparing the biology of species found only  on large islands with those also found on small islands. The islands examined  here are those of the Sunda Shelf, created as a result of the Holocene rise in  sea levels of 120 m. We use four statistical comparisons: comparative analysis by  (phylogenetically) independent contrasts (N = 8 contrasts at the subgeneric or  deeper level), Spearman correlations, stepwise regression, and principle  components analysis (N = 9 subgenera/genera). The genera and one subgenus  considered are: Hylobates, Macaca, Nasalis, Nycticebus, Pongo, Presbytis,  Symphalangus, Tarsius, and Trachypithecus. Traits of risk appear to be large body  mass, low density, large annual home range, and low maximum latitude. Expected  traits that did not correlate with susceptibility were low interbirth interval,  high percent frugivory, high group mass, low altitudinal range, and small  geographic range. The risky traits also apply to just the anthropoids (i.e.,  prosimians excluded). The risky traits are explained if susceptibility is induced  by requirements for a large extent of habitat, a small population size, and  specialization. These findings, which indicate that efficiency and plasticity of  use of the environment separate susceptible from successful primate taxa, might  be relevant to an understanding of hominoid evolution.

TI Life in the end-Permian dead zone.
SO Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB The fossil record of land plants is an obvious source of information on the  dynamics of mass extinctions in the geological past. In conjunction with the  end-Permian ecological crisis, approximately 250 million years ago, palynological  data from East Greenland reveal some unanticipated patterns. We document the  significant time lag between terrestrial ecosystem collapse and selective  extinction among characteristic Late Permian plants. Furthermore, ecological  crisis resulted in an initial increase in plant diversity, instead of a decrease.  Paradoxically, these floral patterns correspond to a "dead zone" in the  end-Permian faunal record, characterized by a paucity of marine invertebrate  megafossils. The time-delayed, end-Permian plant extinctions resemble modeled  "extinction debt" responses of multispecies metapopulations to progressive  habitat destruction.

TI Effects of habitat destruction and resource supplementation in a predator-prey
SO Journal of theoretical biology
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB We developed a mean field, metapopulation model to study the consequences of  habitat destruction on a predator-prey interaction. The model complements and  extends earlier work published by Bascompte and Sol√© (1998, J. theor. Biol.195,  383-393) in that it also permits use of alternative prey (i.e., resource  supplementation) by predators. The current model is stable whenever coexistence  occurs, whereas the earlier model is not stable over the entire domain of  coexistence. More importantly, the current model permits an assessment of the  effect of a generalist predator on the trophic interaction. Habitat destruction  negatively affects the equilibrium fraction of patches occupied by predators, but  the effect is most pronounced for specialists. The effect of habitat destruction  on prey coexisting with predators is dependent on the ratio of extinction risk  due to predation and prey colonization rate. When this ratio is less than unity,  equilibrial prey occupancy of patches declines as habitat destruction increases.  When the ratio exceeds one, equilibrial prey occupancy increases even as habitat  destruction increases; i.e., prey "escape" from predation is facilitated by  habitat loss. Resource supplementation reduces the threshold colonization rate of  predators necessary for their regional persistence, and the benefit derived from  resource supplementation increases in a nonlinear fashion as habitat destruction  increases. We also compared the analytical results to those from a stochastic,  spatially explicit simulation model. The simulation model was a discrete time  analog of our analytical model, with one exception. Colonization was restricted  locally in the simulation, whereas colonization was a global process in the  analytical model. After correcting for differences between nominal and effective  colonization rates, most of the main conclusions of the two types of models were  similar. Some important differences did emerge, however, and we discuss these in  relation to the need to develop fully spatially explicit analytical models.  Finally, we comment on the implications of our results for community structure  and for the conservation of prey species interacting with generalist predators.

DT Journal Article
AB Field studies suggest that populations often go extinct following discrete  changes in the environment. However, populations may avoid extinction by rapidly  adapting to their altered environment. We used a stochastic finite-locus model to  estimate the distance the optimal value of a quantitative trait could shift in a  single step Delta theta(c) without causing more than 5% of the replicate  populations to go extinct. We found that evolution increased the magnitude of  Delta theta(c) by at least two phenotypic standard deviations and that such  evolution could take place within 5--10 generations. Indeed (Delta theta(c))(2)  increased approximately linearly with the logarithm of the initial population  size and the rate of this increase was much greater when heritability was high or  when stabilizing selection was weak. (Delta theta(c))(2) also increased  approximately linearly with the logarithm of per capita fecundity. To our  surprise there was no 'demographic rescue' effect from migration; a population  augmented with migrants from a neighbouring population where environmental  conditions were unchanged was always more likely to go extinct. The addition of  mutation, more loci, density-dependence, or environmental stochasticity had only  small effects on the outcome. We were able to compare our results for closed  populations with density-independent population growth to those from an  analytical model and found good agreement so long as the proportion of the  offspring surviving selection in the initial generations was at least 1%.

TI From life to death--the struggle between chemistry and biology during aging: the
SO Biogerontology

DT Review
AB Biogerontology is the study of the aging of biological systems. This review  addresses the relationship between chemistry and biology during aging, proposing  that chemistry is responsible for the aging of biological systems. In the  continuing struggle between chemistry and biology, chemistry is always the  short-term, tactical winner--death of the individual is inevitable. However,  barring the extinction of species, biology is the long-term, strategic  victor--life survives, and the struggle continues. The rate of random chemical  damage to the genome is considered the major factor determining lifespan of  species. Oxidative stress and reactive oxygen species are recognized as a primary  source of damage in aging and chronic disease. The Maillard reaction, involving  nonenzymatic, oxidative reactions of carbohydrate and lipid substrates, is seen  as an amplifier of reactive oxygen damage. Maillard reaction products in protein  are viewed as integrators of cumulative damage by reactive oxygen, and possibly  as initiators of protective responses, but the primary factor affecting lifespan  is identified as silent cumulative damage to the genome, resulting from imperfect  repair. Maillard reaction inhibitors show promise for treatment of chronic  diseases, such as diabetes and atherosclerosis, and also have a positive effect  on health in normal animals. Future studies should focus on evaluation of the  effects of these inhibitors on genomic damage and lifespan extension.

TI Selective extinction and rapid loss of evolutionary history in the bird fauna.
SO Proceedings. Biological sciences
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB The extinction of species results in a permanent loss of evolutionary history.  Recent theoretical studies show that this loss may be proportionally much smaller  than the loss of species, but under some conditions can exceed it. Such  conditions occur when the phylogenetic tree that describes the evolutionary  relationships among species is highly imbalanced due to differences between  lineages in past speciation and/or extinction rates. I used the taxonomy by C. G.  Sibley and B. L. Monroe Jr to estimate the global loss of bird evolutionary  history from historical and predicted extinctions, and to quantify the ensuing  changes in balance of the bird phylogenetic tree. In the global bird fauna,  evolutionary history is being lost at a high rate, similar to the rate of species  extinction. The bird phylogenetic tree is highly imbalanced, and the imbalance is  increased significantly by anthropogenic extinction. Historically, the elevated  loss of bird evolutionary history has been fuelled mostly by phylogenetic  non-randomness in the extinction of species, but the direct effect of tree  imbalance is substantial and could dominate in the future.

DT Journal Article
AB Although panel discussants disagreed whether the biodiversity crisis constitutes  a mass extinction event, all agreed that current extinction rates are 50-500  times background and are increasing and that the consequences for the future  evolution of life are serious. In response to the on-going rapid decline of  biomes and homogenization of biotas, the panelists predicted changes in species  geographic ranges, genetic risks of extinction, genetic assimilation, natural  selection, mutation rates, the shortening of food chains, the increase in  nutrient-enriched niches permitting the ascendancy of microbes, and the  differential survival of ecological generalists. Rates of evolutionary processes  will change in different groups, and speciation in the larger vertebrates is  essentially over. Action taken over the next few decades will determine how  impoverished the biosphere will be in 1,000 years when many species will suffer  reduced evolvability and require interventionist genetic and ecological  management. Whether the biota will continue to provide the dependable ecological  services humans take for granted is less clear. The discussants offered  recommendations, including two of paramount importance (concerning human  populations and education), seven identifying specific scientific activities to  better equip us for stewardship of the processes of evolution, and one suggesting  that such stewardship is now our responsibility. The ultimate test of  evolutionary biology as a science is not whether it solves the riddles of the  past but rather whether it enables us to manage the future of the biosphere. Our  inability to make clearer predictions about the future of evolution has serious  consequences for both biodiversity and humanity.

TI Food-plant niche selection rather than the presence of ant nests explains
SO Proceedings. Biological sciences
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB It has been suggested that the socially parasitic butterfly Maculinea alcon  detects ant odours before ovipositing on initial larval food plants near colonies  of its obligate ant host Myrmica ruginodis. It has also been suggested that  overcrowding on food plants near M. ruginodis is avoided by an ability to detect  high egg loads, resulting in a switch to selecting plants near less suitable ant  species. If confirmed, this hypothesis (H1) would have serious implications for  the application of current population models aimed at the conservation of  endangered Maculinea species, which are based on the null hypothesis (H0) that  females randomly select food plants whose flower buds are at a precise  phenological stage, making oviposition independent of ants. If H1 were wrong,  practical management based upon its assumptions could lead to the extinction of  protected populations. We present data for the five European species of Maculinea  which show that (i) each oviposits on a phenologically restricted flower-bud  stage, which accounts for the apparent host-ant-mediated niche separation in  sympatric populations of Maculinea nausithous and Maculinea teleius, (ii) there  is no temporal shift in oviposition by Maculinea arion in relation to host ant  distribution or egg density, and (iii) oviposition patterns in 13 populations of  M. alcon's closest relative, Macaulinea rebeli, conform to H0 not H1 predictions.  It is concluded that conservation measures should continue to be based on H0.

TI Patch dynamics and metapopulation theory: the case of successional species.
SO Journal of theoretical biology
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB We present a mathematical framework that combines extinction-colonization  dynamics with the dynamics of patch succession. We draw an analogy between the  epidemiological categorization of individuals (infected, susceptible, latent and  resistant) and the patch structure of a spatially heterogeneous landscape  (occupied-suitable, empty-suitable, occupied-unsuitable and empty-unsuitable).  This approach allows one to consider life-history attributes that influence  persistence in patchy environments (e.g., longevity, colonization ability) in  concert with extrinsic processes (e.g., disturbances, succession) that lead to  spatial heterogeneity in patch suitability. It also allows the incorporation of  seed banks and other dormant life forms, thus broadening patch occupancy dynamics  to include sink habitats. We use the model to investigate how equilibrium patch  occupancy is influenced by four critical parameters: colonization rate,  extinction rate, disturbance frequency and the rate of habitat succession. This  analysis leads to general predictions about how the temporal scaling of patch  succession and extinction-colonization dynamics influences long-term persistence.  We apply the model to herbaceous, early-successional species that inhabit open  patches created by periodic disturbances. We predict the minimum disturbance  frequency required for viable management of such species in the Florida scrub  ecosystem.

SO Journal of theoretical biology

DT Journal Article
AB We develop a set of equations to describe the population dynamics of many  interacting species in food webs. Predator-prey interactions are nonlinear, and  are based on ratio-dependent functional responses. The equations account for  competition for resources between members of the same species, and between  members of different species. Predators divide their total hunting/foraging  effort between the available prey species according to an evolutionarily stable  strategy (ESS). The ESS foraging behaviour does not correspond to the predictions  of optimal foraging theory. We use the population dynamics equations in  simulations of the Webworld model of evolving ecosystems. New species are added  to an existing food web due to speciation events, whilst species become extinct  due to coevolution and competition. We study the dynamics of species-diversity in  Webworld on a macro-evolutionary time-scale. Coevolutionary interactions are  strong enough to cause continuous overturn of species, in contrast to our  previous Webworld simulations with simpler population dynamics. Although there  are significant fluctuations in species diversity because of speciation and  extinction, very large-scale extinction avalanches appear to be absent from the  dynamics, and we find no evidence for self-organized criticality.

AB Since the Age of Exploration began, there has been a drastic breaching of  biogeographic barriers that previously had isolated the continental biotas for  millions of years. We explore the nature of these recent biotic exchanges and  their consequences on evolutionary processes. The direct evidence of evolutionary  consequences of the biotic rearrangements is of variable quality, but the results  of trajectories are becoming clear as the number of studies increases. There are  examples of invasive species altering the evolutionary pathway of native species  by competitive exclusion, niche displacement, hybridization, introgression,  predation, and ultimately extinction. Invaders themselves evolve in response to  their interactions with natives, as well as in response to the new abiotic  environment. Flexibility in behavior, and mutualistic interactions, can aid in  the success of invaders in their new environment.

DT Journal Article
AB A new class of surface-modified dendrimers has been prepared by reactions of 8  equiv of the terpyridine-functionalized polyether monodendrons with a polyhedral  oligomeric silsesquioxane (POSS) core. Subsequent reactions of these spherically  shaped organic dendrimers with Ru(II)-based precursors afford photo- and  redox-active metallodendrimers. These new dendrimers have been characterized  using a combination of mass spectral analysis (MALDI-TOF/MS, ESI/MS, and FAB/MS),  nuclear magnetic resonance (1H, 13C, 29Si, and 31P(1H) NMR), photophysical  analyses (electronic absorption, emission, excited-state lifetime, and quantum  yield) and electrochemical measurement (cyclic voltammetry). Specifically,  31P(1H) NMR is used to monitor the completion of reactions and the purity of  dendrimers and metallodendrimers. These new metallodendrimers exhibit large  extinction coefficients that coincide with the number of peripheral Ru(II)-based  chromophores. With the use of (-CH2-Ph-tpy)RuII(bpy)2 type of chromophores, all  metallodendrimers are found emissive at room temperature, with lifetimes in the  range of 605-890 ns. Photophysical data also indicate similar steady-state  emission maxima and single-exponential decay kinetics for all metallodendrimers,  and the observed overall quantum yields of the G1, G2, and G3 metallodendrimers  are found to be 14, 20, and 7 times higher than that of the monomeric model  complex (CH3-Ph-tpy)Ru(bpy)2(PF6)2. Electrochemical studies reveal the presence  of surface-confined species, in addition to the ligand-centered and  metal-centered redox processes.

AB Invasion of plant-based life support systems by plant pathogens could cause plant  disease and disruption of life support capability. Root rot caused by the fungus,  Pythium, was observed during tests of prototype plant growth systems containing  wheat at the Kennedy Space Center (KSC). We conducted experiments to determine if  the presence of complex microbial communities in the plant root zone  (rhizosphere) resisted invasion by the Pythium species isolated from the wheat  root. Rhizosphere inocula of different complexity (as assayed by community-level  physiological profile: CLPP) were developed using a dilution/extinction approach,  followed by growth in hydroponic rhizosphere. Pythium growth on wheat roots and  concomitant decreases in plant growth were inversely related to the complexity of  the inocula during 20-day experiments in static hydroponic systems. Pythium was  found on the seeds of several different wheat cultivars used in controlled  environmental studies, but it is unclear if the seed-borne fungal strain(s) were  identical to the pathogenic strain recovered from the KSC studies. Attempts to  control pathogens and their effects in hydroponic life support systems should  include early inoculation with complex microbial communities, which is consistent  with ecological theory.

SO Journal of comparative physiology. B, Biochemical, systemic, and environmental

DT Journal Article
AB Prolonged drought, necessitating conservation of water, is one of the major  environmental challenges faced by many Australian marsupials. Radioactive  isotopes of water and sodium were used to assess the ability of two species of  marsupial wallabies to maintain water and electrolyte balance during periods of  extreme water deprivation in the arid Pilbara region of Western Australia. The  spectacled hare-wallaby, Lagorchestes conspicillatus, has the lowest  mass-specific rate of water turnover at 27.5 ml.kg(-0.82).day(-1) yet reported  for any mammal and was two to three orders of magnitude lower than that of the  Rothschild's rock-wallaby, Petrogale rothschildi. Studies of renal function show  that the hare-wallaby conserves water by producing a highly concentrated urine  under the influence of lysine vasopressin (LVP), the anti-diuretic hormone (ADH)  in macropodid marsupials. In contrast, rock-wallabies show unusual renal  responses to water deprivation, with no change in LVP levels and a limited  response to water deprivation involving a reduction in renal plasma flow and  glomerular filtration rate, with no significant change in tubular function. Both  species are able to maintain water and electrolyte homeostasis during periods of  drought, highlighting the efficacy of their differing adaptive solutions to the  problem of water scarcity, although the hare-wallaby is superior to the  rock-wallaby in this respect. Rock-wallabies appear to rely primarily on  behavioural rather than physiological responses for their survival in the Pilbara  and appear to be more vulnerable to extinction in the event of significant  habitat modification. The secure nature of their rock habitat, however, means  that they have suffered less than hare-wallabies in the recent past.

AB Hatchery programmes for supplementing depleted populations of fish are undergoing  a worldwide expansion and have provoked concern about their ramifications for  populations of wild fish. In particular, Pacific salmon are artificially  propagated in enormous numbers in order to compensate for numerous human insults  to their populations, yet the ecological impacts of this massive hatchery effort  are poorly understood. Here we test the hypothesis that massive numbers of  hatchery-raised chinook salmon reduce the marine survival of wild Snake River  spring chinook, a threatened species in the USA. Based on a unique 25-year  time-series, we demonstrated a strong, negative relationship between the survival  of chinook salmon and the number of hatchery fish released, particularly during  years of poor ocean conditions. Our results suggest that hatchery programmes that  produce increasingly higher numbers of fish may hinder the recovery of depleted  wild populations.

TI A test of whether rates of speciation were unusually high during the Cambrian
SO Proceedings. Biological sciences
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB The Cambrian radiation represents an interval when nearly 20 animal phyla appear  in the fossil record in a short geological time span; however, whether this  radiation also represents a period of extremely rapid speciation remains unclear.  Here, a stochastic framework is used to test the null hypothesis that diversity  changes in one of the dominant Early Cambrian groups, the olenelloid trilobites,  could be produced by tempos of speciation known to have operated during later  time periods. Two continuous-time models, the Yule model and the birth and death  process model, and one discrete-time model, the Bienaym√©-Galton-Watson branching  process model, were used. No statistical evidence for uniquely high rates of  speciation during the radiation in these trilobites was found when the  continuous-time models were used with low or moderate extinction rates, the rates  typically associated with the Cambrian radiation, although the p values are  fairly low or, in one case, significant when high extinction rates were used.  However, rates of speciation were higher than the average Phanerozoic rates of  speciation. The discrete-time model produced equivocal results: either rates were  unusually high or the model is inapplicable during the Cambrian radiation. This  suggests that there was nothing unique about evolutionary processes relating to  the tempo of speciation during the Cambrian radiation.

TI Population growth of Gyrodactylus salaris (Monogenea) on Norwegian and Baltic
SO Parasitology
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB Reproductive success of Gvrodactylus salaris from River Lierelva was compared  experimentally on 3 stocks of salmon (12.5 degrees C +/- 0.2). Isolated fish from  2 susceptible Norwegian stocks (Rivers Lier and Alta) and 1 resistant Baltic  stock of salmon (River Neva) were infected with a single gravid worm in order to  record the temporal sequence of births and age at death of individual parasites.  Establishment success (proportion of worms surviving to give birth) was generally  low and mortality high, but significantly fewer worms survived on Neva (45% with  mean survival of 3.5 days) compared to Alta and Lier fish (60 % mean survival 7.9  and 5.2 days, respectively). There was a dramatic difference in parasite  fecundity between the host stocks: only 2 births occurred on Neva fish compared  to third and fourth births on both Alta and Lier hosts. The timing of the first  birth was more variable on Neva hosts and was significantly extended (mean 2.3  days) relative to that on Alta and Neva fish (1.8 days). However, timing of the  second birth did not vary on any of the 3 salmon stocks. Age-specific mortality  and fecundity data are consistent with exponential population growth of G.  salaris on Alta and Lier fish but eventual extinction on Neva hosts. This is the  first demonstration that gyrodactylids maintained on different host stocks  exhibit variations in fecundity, development and mortality, which may in turn  account for the variable virulence noted when G. salaris infects different  salmonid hosts.

TI Effects of light intensity, n-alcohols, water-soluble colorants, and solution
SO Pharmaceutical development and technology
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB Effects of various factors, such as light intensity, polarizability of n-alcohol  solvents, addition of colorants, and viscosity of solutions on the kinetics of  the photoisomerization of therapeutically effective E-isomer of sorivudine to its  less effective Z-isomer were studied. Solutions of known concentrations of  E-isomer or Z-isomer in water or in a series of n-alcohols were directly exposed  to ultraviolet (UV) A light, or visible light of 400 or 900 foot candles (fc).  E-isomer solutions containing various colorants at 1% w/v, or in a series of  poloxamer solutions of different viscosities, were also exposed to 400 or 900 fc  light. Using the stability-indicating HPLC assay, which showed mass-balance  between the starting isomer and the converting isomer, the kinetics of  photoisomerization were monitored. The photoisomerization reaction, which takes  place on the vinyl side chain, was found to be a first-order reversible reaction.  In water, the rate of conversion of E-isomer to Z-isomer was faster than that of  Z-isomer to E-isomer, since, E-isomer with higher extinction coefficient absorbed  substantially more light than Z-isomer. The rate of photoisomerization increased  with the intensity of the visible light and was very rapid in the presence of UV  A light (300 to 400 nm), which is to be expected based on the 239 nm and 283 nm  absorption maxima of sorivudine. Addition of water-soluble colorants retarded the  photoisomerization process significantly, especially as the maximum absorption  wavelengths (lambda max) of the colorants approached the UV region. The rate of  photoisomerization increased with increasing polarizability (alpha s) of the  n-alcohol solvents. Polarizable solvents such as alcohols could compensate for  the electron density built up in the excited state, and thus facilitated the  photoisomerization process. The rate of photoisomerization decreased as the  viscosity of solution increased. This may be attributed to the fact that the  twisting of the C=C bond in the excited state can be inhibited by the friction  imposed by the viscous medium.

SO Journal of theoretical biology

DT Journal Article
AB To examine the impact of genetic neighborhood size and habitat shape on genetic  load and the accumulation of deleterious mutation, individual-based simulations  were performed in continuously distributed habitats. The risk of extinction  increased as both the area of the habitat and the neighborhood size decreased.  When the neighborhood area became smaller than the habitat area, habitat shape  also began to influence the risk of extinction by mutation loads, expected time  to extinction being shorter in longer and narrower habitats than in a square  habitat. Both the number of homozygous deleterious loci per individual and the  mutation load in the population increased as the neighborhood size and total  population size decreased. Neighborhood size and total population size both  independently affected the average number of homozygous deleterious loci per  individual. In addition, as the ratio of the long to the short side of the  rectangle of a habitat increased, the average number of homozygous deleterious  loci increased. When the areas of the habitats were held constant, the average  number of homozygous loci and the mutation loads were smallest for a regular  square and largest for the longest, narrowest habitat. These results suggest that  the spatial genetic structure of an individual is an important factor in the  accumulation of deleterious mutations and the risk of extinction by mutation  meltdown.

TI Disrupting evolutionary processes: the effect of habitat fragmentation on
SO Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB Humans affect biodiversity at the genetic, species, community, and ecosystem  levels. This impact on genetic diversity is critical, because genetic diversity  is the raw material of evolutionary change, including adaptation and speciation.  Two forces affecting genetic variation are genetic drift (which decreases genetic  variation within but increases genetic differentiation among local populations)  and gene flow (which increases variation within but decreases differentiation  among local populations). Humans activities often augment drift and diminish gene  flow for many species, which reduces genetic variation in local populations and  prevents the spread of adaptive complexes outside their population of origin,  thereby disrupting adaptive processes both locally and globally within a species.  These impacts are illustrated with collared lizards (Crotaphytus collaris) in the  Missouri Ozarks. Forest fire suppression has reduced habitat and disrupted gene  flow in this lizard, thereby altering the balance toward drift and away from gene  flow. This balance can be restored by managed landscape burns. Some have argued  that, although human-induced fragmentation disrupts adaptation, it will also  ultimately produce new species through founder effects. However, population  genetic theory and experiments predict that most fragmentation events caused by  human activities will facilitate not speciation, but local extinction. Founder  events have played an important role in the macroevolution of certain groups, but  only when ecological opportunities are expanding rather than contracting. The  general impact of human activities on genetic diversity disrupts or diminishes  the capacity for adaptation, speciation, and macroevolutionary change. This  impact will ultimately diminish biodiversity at all levels.

DT Review
DE NASA Discipline Exobiology; Non-NASA Center
AB Data from palaeontology and biodiversity suggest that the global biota should  produce an average of three new species per year. However, the fossil record  shows large variation around this mean. Rates of origination have declined  through the Phanerozoic. This appears to have been largely a function of sorting  among higher taxa (especially classes), which exhibit characteristic rates of  speciation (and extinction) that differ among them by nearly an order of  magnitude. Secular decline of origination rates is hardly constant, however; many  positive deviations reflect accelerated speciation during rebounds from mass  extinctions. There has also been general decline in rates of speciation within  major taxa through their histories, although rates have tended to remain higher  among members in tropical regions. Finally, pulses of speciation appear sometimes  to be associated with climate change, although moderate oscillations of climate  do not necessarily promote speciation despite forcing changes in species'  geographical ranges.

TI Thiolate-imidazolium ion pair is not an obligatory catalytic entity of cysteine
SO Biochemistry
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB Cysteine peptidases are thought to attack the substrate by a thiolate-imidazolium  ion-pair, as demonstrated with the most extensively studied papain. Picornavirus  proteinases (picornains), a different family of cysteine peptidases, are  structurally related to the trypsin family of serine peptidases, whose  catalytically competent histidine operates as a general base catalyst. Measuring  the absorbance change upon alkylation of picornains at 250 nm, where the  nondissociated thiol group has a negligible absorbance relative to the ionized  form, one can test the ionization state of the catalytic cysteine. For such  studies, we have prepared and used a mutated variant of the poliovirus proteinase  3C, which contains a single thiol group. The pH dependence of the molar  extinction coefficient has undoubtedly shown that picornain 3C contains an  ordinary thiol group rather than the usual ion-pair. Therefore, the imidazole  assistance, demonstrated in alkylation reactions, is presumably general base  catalysis, as found with serine peptidases. Kinetic studies on k(cat)/K(m) gave  large inverse deuterium isotope effects, which may overcompensate the reverse  values characteristic of the potential general base catalysis. The inverse  effects is associated with the stabilization of the protein structure in heavy  water.

TI Human demography and reserve size predict wildlife extinction in West Africa.
SO Proceedings. Biological sciences
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB Species-area models have become the primary tool used to predict baseline  extinction rates for species in isolated habitats, and have influenced  conservation and land-use planning worldwide. In particular, these models have  been used to predict extinction rates following the loss or fragmentation of  natural habitats in the absence of direct human influence on species persistence.  Thus, where direct human influences, such as hunting, put added pressure on  species in remnant habitat patches, we should expect to observe extinction rates  higher than those predicted by simple species-area models. Here, we show that  extinction rates for 41 species of large mammals in six nature reserves in West  Africa are 14-307 times higher than those predicted by models based on reserve  size alone. Human population and reserve size accounted for 98% of the observed  variation in extinction rates between reserves. Extinction occurred at higher  rates than predicted by species-area models for carnivores, primates and  ungulates, and at the highest rates overall near reserve borders. Our results  indicate that, where the harvest of wildlife is common, conservation plans should  focus on increasing the size of reserves and reducing the rate of hunting.

TI Is salivary histatin 5 a metallopeptide?
SO Biochimica et biophysica acta
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB Histatins are small histidine-rich salivary polypeptides which exhibit  antimicrobial activity against Candida albicans. This antimicrobial activity has  been ascribed in part to a high content of basic amino acids. However, unlike  most other antimicrobial proteins histatins have a high content of histidine,  tyrosine and acidic amino acids known to participate in metal ion coordination.  This study was conducted to test whether histatin 5 could bind zinc and copper  which are metals present in salivary secretions and whole saliva. Physical  binding parameters and spectral properties of zinc- and copper-histatin complexes  were investigated in order to obtain direct evidence of these interactions. A  spectrophotometric competition assay using the metallochromic indicator murexide  showed that histatin 5 dissociates metal indicator complexes containing zinc or  copper ions. Absorption spectra of histatin 5 at increasing copper chloride  concentrations resulted in higher absorbance in the 230-280 nm wavelength range  and this spectral change was saturated at a peptide:metal molar ratio of approx.  1:1. A corresponding band was observed in the visible range of the spectrum with  a maximum and molar extinction coefficient corresponding to that of copper  binding to an ATCUN motif. Quantitative assessment of zinc and copper binding to  histatin 5 using isothermal titration calorimetry revealed at least one high  affinity site for each metal, with binding constants of 1.2x10(5) and 2.6x10(7)  M(-1), respectively. These results indicate that histatin 5 exhibits  metallopeptide-like properties. The precise biological significance of this has  not yet been established but histatins may contribute significantly to salivary  metal binding capacity.

TI Nested assemblages resulting from host size variation: the case of endoparasite
SO International journal for parasitology
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB Nested species subsets are a common pattern in many types of communities found in  insular or fragmented habitats. Nestedness occurs in some communities of  ectoparasites of fish, as does the exact opposite departure from random assembly,  anti-nestedness. Here, we looked for nested and anti-nested patterns in the  species composition of communities of internal parasites of 23 fish populations  from two localities in Finland. We also compared various community parameters of  nested and anti-nested assemblages of parasites, and determined whether  nestedness may result simply from a size-related accumulation of parasite species  by feeding fish hosts. Nested parasite communities were characterised by higher  prevalence (proportion of infected fish) and intensities of infection (number of  parasites per fish) than anti-nested communities; the two types of non-random  communities did not differ with respect to parasite species richness, however. In  addition, the correlation between fish size and the number of parasite species  harboured by individual fish was much stronger in nested assemblages than in  anti-nested ones, where it was often nil. These results were shown not to be  artefacts of sampling effort or host phylogeny. They apply to both assemblages of  adult and larval parasites, which were treated separately. Since species of  larval parasites are extremely unlikely to interact with one another in fish  hosts, the establishment of nestedness appears independent of the potential  action of interspecific interactions. The species composition of these parasite  communities is not determined from within the community, but rather by the  extrinsic influence of host feeding rates and how they amplify differences among  parasite species in probabilities of colonisation or extinction. Nested patterns  occur in parasite communities whose fish hosts accumulate parasites in a  predictable fashion proportional to their size, whereas anti-nested communities  occur in parasite communities whose fish hosts do not, possibly because of  dietary specialisation preventing them from sampling the entire pool of parasite  species available locally. Thus, nestedness in parasite communities may result  from processes somewhat different from those generating nested patterns in  free-living communities.

AB A computer simulation of North American end-Pleistocene human and large herbivore  population dynamics correctly predicts the extinction or survival of 32 out of 41  prey species. Slow human population growth rates, random hunting, and low maximum  hunting effort are assumed; additional parameters are based on published values.  Predictions are close to observed values for overall extinction rates, human  population densities, game consumption rates, and the temporal overlap of humans  and extinct species. Results are robust to variation in unconstrained parameters.  This fully mechanistic model accounts for megafaunal extinction without invoking  climate change and secondary ecological effects.

TI Time-resolved characterization of diesel particulate emissions. 2. Instruments
SO Environmental science & technology
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB The measurement of elemental carbon (EC) and organic carbon (OC) mass for  particles emitted by diesel vehicles is currently accomplished using particle  collection on filters, followed by analysis using the thermal/optical reflectance  carbon analysis method (TOR) or one of its variations. Such filter methods limit  time resolution to a minimum of several minutes, making it impossible to study  emissions during transient operating conditions. Testing of five different  measurement methods has demonstrated that fast response measurement of diesel  exhaust particulate EC and OC concentrations, consistent with TOR filter  measurements, is feasible using existing technology. EC mass concentrations are  best measured through determination of particulate light absorption with a  photoacoustic instrument or determination of light extinction with a smoke meter.  The photoacoustic instrument has the better dynamic range and sensitivity,  whereas the smoke meter is a simpler instrument. Fast response OC measurements  cannot be made with any single instrument tested. However, a combination of real  time weighing as implemented in the tapered element oscillating microbalance with  the photoacoustic instrument has been shown to be capable of determining OC  concentrations with good time response. The addition of a nephelometer to the OC  measurement could potentially improve time resolution, freedom from  interferences, and sensitivity.

TI Impact event at the Permian-Triassic boundary: evidence from extraterrestrial
SO Science (New York, N.Y.)
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB The Permian-Triassic boundary (PTB) event, which occurred about 251.4 million  years ago, is marked by the most severe mass extinction in the geologic record.  Recent studies of some PTB sites indicate that the extinctions occurred very  abruptly, consistent with a catastrophic, possibly extraterrestrial, cause.  Fullerenes (C60 to C200) from sediments at the PTB contain trapped helium and  argon with isotope ratios similar to the planetary component of carbonaceous  chondrites. These data imply that an impact event (asteroidal or cometary)  accompanied the extinction, as was the case for the Cretaceous-Tertiary  extinction event about 65 million years ago.

TI pH-Dependent Excited-State Dynamics of [Ru(bpy)(3)](2+)-Modified Amino Acids:
SO Inorganic chemistry
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB The pH-dependent photophysical properties of a series of polypyridyl  ruthenium-substituted amino acids were investigated by steady-state and  time-resolved luminescence spectroscopy. [H(3)N-DAPA(Rub(2)m)-OH](PF(6))(3) (1),  [H(3)N-DABA(Rub(2)m)-OH](PF(6))(3) (2), [H(3)N-Orn(Rub(2)m)-OH](PF(6))(3) (3),  and [H(3)N-Lys(Rub(2)m)-OH](PF(6))(3) (4) were obtained by formation of an amide  link between the omega-NH(2) group of the respective commercially available amino  acid and [Rub(2)(m-OH)](2+) (b = bipyridine, m-OH =  4'-methyl-2,2'-bipyridine-4-carboxylic acid). Due to the absence of significant  electronic interactions between the ruthenium chromophore and the amino acid  moieties, the energetics and extinction coefficients of the absorption spectra of  1-4 do not change as a function of pH. The luminescence intensities of these  complexes, however, show a marked dependence on pH. At low pH (<2), quenching via  excited-state protonation of the amide link leads to short lifetimes. In the pH  2-8 range, the lifetimes depend on the amino acid side chain length of the  complex. At high pH (>9), lifetimes are approaching that of [Ru(bpy)(3)](2+),  suggesting that the amino acid moiety has a negligible effect on nonadiabatic  pathways in the excited-state decay of the ruthenium moiety. Our results are  discussed with respect to the rapidly growing interest in ruthenium-substituted  amino acids as spectroscopic and mechanistic tools in biological systems.

TI Rapid mutational declines of viability in Drosophila.
SO Genetical research
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB High rates of mildly deleterious mutation could cause the extinction of small  populations, reduce neutral genetic variation and provide an evolutionary  advantage for sex. In the first attempts to estimate the rate of mildly  deleterious mutation, Mukai and Ohnishi allowed spontaneous mutations to  accumulate on D. melanogaster second chromosomes shielded from recombination and  selection. Viability of the shielded chromosomes appeared to decline rapidly,  implying a deleterious mutation rate on the order of one per zygote per  generation. These results have been challenged, however; at issue is whether  Mukai and Ohnishi may have confounded viability declines caused by mutation with  declines resulting from environmental changes or other extraneous factors. Here,  using a method not sensitive to non-mutational viability changes, I reanalyse the  previous mutation-accumulation (MA) experiments, and report the results of a new  one. I show that in each of four experiments, including Mukai's two experiments,  viability declines due to mildly deleterious mutations were rapid. The results  give no support for the view that Mukai overestimated the declines. Although  there is substantial variation in estimates of genomic mutation rates from the  experiments, this variation is probably due to some combination of sampling  error, strain differences and differences in assay conditions, rather than to  failure to distinguish mutational and non-mutational viability changes.

TI Back-trajectory analyses of fine particulate matter measured at Big Bend National
SO The Science of the total environment
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB Analyses of the sources of fine particles associated with visibility reduction at  Big Bend National Park during a 10-year period from 1989-1998 and from a regional  visibility scoping study conducted during September and October 1996 at 19 sites  in Texas and Mexico are summarized and compared. Fine sulfate particles are the  largest fraction of the fine mass, and scattering by sulfates is estimated to be  nearly half of the non-Rayleigh light extinction at Big Bend. Fine particulate  sulfur concentrations are seasonal, with the highest values occurring during the  summer and fall when back trajectory analyses show that air masses are most  likely to arrive at Big Bend from the southeast after passing over Mexico or from  areas to the northeast including east Texas. Episodically, high concentrations of  fine mass and high light extinction values can be due to other species such as  fine organic carbon or blowing soil dust. Organic carbon concentrations are often  extremely high during the spring, especially during May. A combination of back  trajectory analyses and the coincidence of high organic carbon and high non-soil  potassium concentrations leads to the hypothesis that these concentrations are  due to fires, primarily seasonal agricultural burning in Mexico and Central  America. Fine soil concentrations often reach values that are twice the annual  mean during July. These concentrations also frequently have high Al/Ca ratios,  indicative of Saharan dust. Back trajectories associated with these events show  air masses arriving from the southeast and are consistent with the hypothesis of  transport of air masses from Africa during July. There is a high frequency of  transport of air masses from Mexico to Big Bend, especially during the summer  when fine mass concentrations and light extinction are highest. Therefore,  sources and potential sources of sulfates and other fine particles in Mexico,  particularly in areas southeast of the park have a high likelihood of  contributing to visibility degradation at the park. Source areas to the northeast  of the park, in east Texas and farther upwind also contribute to high fine  sulfate concentrations.

TI The biotic crisis and the future of evolution.

DT Journal Article
AB The biotic crisis overtaking our planet is likely to precipitate a major  extinction of species. That much is well known. Not so well known but probably  more significant in the long term is that the crisis will surely disrupt and  deplete certain basic processes of evolution, with consequences likely to persist  for millions of years. Distinctive features of future evolution could include a  homogenization of biotas, a proliferation of opportunistic species, a  pest-and-weed ecology, an outburst of speciation among taxa that prosper in  human-dominated ecosystems, a decline of biodisparity, an end to the speciation  of large vertebrates, the depletion of "evolutionary powerhouses" in the tropics,  and unpredictable emergent novelties. Despite this likelihood, we have only a  rudimentary understanding of how we are altering the evolutionary future. As a  result of our ignorance, conservation policies fail to reflect long-term  evolutionary aspects of biodiversity loss.

AB We formulate and analyse a stochastic version of the Verhulst deterministic model  for density-dependent growth of a single population. Three parameter regions with  qualitatively different behaviours are identified. Explicit approximations of the  quasi-stationary distribution and of the expected time to extinction are  presented in each of these regions. The quasi-stationary distribution is  approximately normal, and the time to extinction is long, in one of these  regions. Another region has a short time to extinction and a quasi-stationary  distribution that is approximately truncated geometric. A third region is a  transition region between these two. Here the time to extinction is moderately  long and the quasi-stationary distribution has a more complicated behaviour.  Numerical illustrations are given.

TI Demography of the endangered North Atlantic right whale.
SO Nature
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB Northern right whales (Eubalaena glacialis) were formerly abundant in the  northwestern Atlantic, but by 1900 they had been hunted to near extinction. After  the end of commercial whaling the population was thought to be recovering slowly;  however, evidence indicates that it has been declining since about 1990 (ref. 1).  There are now fewer than 300 individuals, and the species may already be  functionally extinct owing to demographic stochasticity or the difficulty of  females locating mates in the vast Atlantic Ocean (Allee effect). Using a data  set containing over 10,000 sightings of photographically identified individuals  we estimated trends in right whale demographic parameters since 1980. Here we  construct, using these estimates, matrix population models allowing us to analyse  the causes of right whale imperilment. Mortality has increased, especially among  mother whales, causing declines in population growth rate, life expectancy and  the mean lifetime number of reproductive events between the period 1980-1995.  Increased mortality of mother whales can explain the declining population size,  suggesting that the population is not doomed to extinction as a result of the  Allee effect. An analysis of extinction time shows that demographic stochasticity  has only a small effect, but preventing the deaths of only two female right  whales per year would increase the population growth rate to replacement level.

TI The consequences of dioecy for seed dispersal: modeling the seed-shadow handicap.
SO Evolution; international journal of organic evolution
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB Recent evidence has suggested that clades of dioecious angiosperms have fewer  extant species on average than those of cosexual (hermaphroditic and monoecious)  relatives. Reasons for the decrease in speciation rates and/or increase in  extinction rates are only beginning to be investigated. One possibility is that  dioecious species suffer a competitive disadvantage with cosexuals because only  half of the individuals in a dioecious population are seed bearing. When only  females produce seed, offspring will be more spatially clumped and will  experience more local resource competition than when every individual produces  seed. We examine two spatially explicit models to determine the effect of a  reduction in seed dispersers on the invasibility and persistence of dioecious  populations. Even though dioecious females were allowed to produce twice as many  seeds as cosexuals, our results show that a reduction in the number of seed  dispersers causes a decrease in the ability of dioecious progeny to find  uninhabited sites, thus reducing persistence times. These results suggest that  the maintenance of dioecy in the presence of hermaphroditic competitors requires  a substantial increase in relative fitness and/or a large dispersal advantage of  dioecious seeds.

TI Energy, volatile production, and climatic effects of the Chicxulub
SO Journal of geophysical research
LA English
DT Journal Article
DE NASA Center JPL; NASA Discipline Exobiology; Non-NASA Center
AB A comprehensive analysis of volatiles in the Chicxulub impact strongly supports  the hypothesis that impact-generated sulfate aerosols caused over a decade of  global cooling, acid rain, and disruption of ocean circulation, which contributed  to the mass extinction at the Cretaceous/Tertiary (K/T) boundary. The crater  size, meteoritic content of the K/T boundary clay, and impact models indicate  that the Chicxulub crater was formed by a short period comet or an asteroid  impact that released 0.7-3.4 x 10(31) ergs of energy. Impact models and  experiments combined with estimates of volatiles in the projectile and target  rocks predict that over 200 gigatons (Gt) each of SO2 and water vapor, and over  500 Gt of CO2, were globally distributed in the stratosphere by the impact.  Additional volatiles may have been produced on a global or regional scale that  formed sulfate aerosols rapidly in cooler parts of the vapor plume, causing an  early, intense pulse of sulfuric acid rain. Estimates of the conversion rate of  stratospheric SO2 and water vapor to sulfate aerosol, based on volcanic  production of sulfate aerosols, coupled with calculations of diffusion,  coagulation, and sedimentation, demonstrate that the 200 Gt stratospheric SO2 and  water vapor reservoir would produce sulfate aerosols for 12 years. These sulfate  aerosols caused a second pulse of acid rain that was global. Radiative transfer  modeling of the aerosol clouds demonstrates (1) that if the initial rapid pulse  of sulfate aerosols was global, photosynthesis may have been shut down for 6  months and (2) that for the second prolonged aerosol cloud, solar transmission  dropped 80% by the end of first year and remained 50% below normal for 9 years.  As a result, global average surface temperatures probably dropped between 5  degrees and 31 degrees K, suggesting that global near-freezing conditions may  have been reached. Impact-generated CO2 caused less than 1 degree K greenhouse  warming and therefore was insignificant compare to the sulfate cooling. The  magnitude of sulfate cooling depends largely upon the rate of ocean mixing as  surface waters cool, sink, and are replaced by upwelling of deep ocean water.  This upwelling apparently drastically altered ocean stratification and  circulation, which may explain the global collapse of the delta 13C gradient  between surface and deep ocean waters at the K/T boundary.

TI Coexistence under positive frequency dependence.
SO Proceedings. Biological sciences
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB Negative frequency dependence resulting from interspecific interactions is  considered a driving force in allowing the coexistence of competitors. While  interactions between species and genotypes can also result in positive frequency  dependence, positive frequency dependence has usually been credited with  hastening the extinction of rare types and is not thought to contribute to  coexistence. In the present paper, we develop a stochastic cellular automata  model that allows us to vary the scale of frequency dependence and the scale of  dispersal. The results of this model indicate that positive frequency dependence  will allow the coexistence of two species at a greater rate than would be  expected from chance. This coexistence arises from the generation of banding  patterns that will be stable over long time-periods. As a result, we found that  positive frequency-dependent interactions over local spatial scales promote  coexistence over neutral interactions. This result was robust to variation in  boundary conditions within the simulation and to variation in levels of  disturbance. Under all conditions, coexistence is enhanced as the strength of  positive frequency-dependent interactions is increased.

TI BLIMP-I mediates extinction of major histocompatibility class II transactivator
SO Nature immunology
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB Class II transactivator (CIITA), a coactivator required for class II major  histocompatibility complex (MHC) transcription, is expressed in B cells but  extinguished in plasma cells. This report identifies B lymphocyte-induced  maturation protein I (BLIMP-I), a transcriptional repressor that is capable of  triggering plasma cell differentiation, as a developmentally regulated repressor  of CIITA transcription. BLIMP-I represses the B cell-specific promoter of the  human gene that encodes CIITA (MHC2TA) in a binding site-dependent manner.  Decreased CIITA correlates with increased BLIMP-I during plasma cell  differentiation in cultured cells. Ectopic expression of BLIMP-I represses  endogenous mRNA for CIITA and the CIITA targets, class II MHC, invariant chain  and H2-DM (the murine equivalent of HLA-DM) in primary splenic B cells as well as  18-81 pre-B cells. Thus, the BLIMP-I program of B cell differentiation includes  loss of antigen presentation via extinction of CIITA expression.

TI Stochastic models of a parasitic infection, exhibiting three basic reproduction
SO Journal of mathematical biology
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB Two closely related stochastic models of parasitic infection are investigated: a  non-linear model, where density dependent constraints are included, and a linear  model appropriate to the initial behaviour of an epidemic. Host-mortality is  included in both models. These models are appropriate to transmission between  homogeneously mixing hosts, where the amount of infection which is transferred  from one host to another at a single contact depends on the number of parasites  in the infecting host. In both models, the basic reproduction ratio R0 can be  defined to be the lifetime expected number of offspring of an adult parasite  under ideal conditions, but it does not necessarily contain the information  needed to separate growth from extinction of infection. In fact we find three  regions for a certain parameter where different combinations of parameters  determine the behavior of the models. The proofs involve martingale and coupling  methods.

TI Mutational meltdown in laboratory yeast populations.
SO Evolution; international journal of organic evolution
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB In small or repeatedly bottlenecked populations, mutations are expected to  accumulate by genetic drift, causing fitness declines. In mutational meltdown  models, such fitness declines further reduce population size, thus accelerating  additional mutation accumulation and leading to extinction. Because the rate of  mutation accumulation is determined partly by the mutation rate, the risk and  rate of meltdown are predicted to increase with increasing mutation rate. We  established 12 replicate populations of Saccharomyces cerevisiae from each of two  isogenic strains whose genomewide mutation rates differ by approximately two  orders of magnitude. Each population was transferred daily by a fixed dilution  that resulted in an effective population size near 250. Fitness declines that  reduce growth rates were expected to reduce the numbers of cells transferred  after dilution, thus reducing population size and leading to mutational meltdown.  Through 175 daily transfers and approximately 2900 generations, two extinctions  occurred, both in populations with elevated mutation rates. For one of these  populations there is direct evidence that extinction resulted from mutational  meltdown: Extinction immediately followed a major fitness decline, and it  recurred consistently in replicate populations reestablished from a sample frozen  after this fitness decline, but not in populations founded from a predecline  sample. Wild-type populations showed no trend to decrease in size and, on  average, they increased in fitness.

TI Amygdala lesions block conditioned enhancement of the early component of the rat
SO Behavioral neuroscience
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB A tone conditioned stimulus (CS) previously paired with a grid shock  unconditioned stimulus (US) can greatly enhance the early electromyographic (EMG)  component (R1) of the rat eyeblink reflex. The hypothesis that the central  nucleus of the amygdala (ACe) is an essential part of the circuitry mediating  conditioned R1 enhancement was tested. After bilateral ACe lesions (L) or a sham  operation (S), rats received paired presentations of the CS and US (P) or  explicitly unpaired CS and US presentations (U), resulting in 4 groups: P/S, P/L,  U/S, and U/L. ACe lesions completely prevented conditioned R1 enhancement, which  was only exhibited in Group P/S. In the latter group, the "preextinction"  conditioned enhancement effect was roughly a 2-fold increase in the R1 magnitude.  Circuit-level mechanisms are discussed, and some advantages of the eyeblink EMG  response in this general conditioning paradigm are considered.

TI Chromosome races with Pliocene origins: evidence from mtDNA.
SO Heredity
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB There are eight distinct chromosomal races of the New Zealand weta Hemideina  thoracica. We used mtDNA sequence data to test the hypothesis that these races  originated on islands during the early Pliocene (7--4 million years ago). Nine  major mitochondrial lineages were identified from 65 cytochrome oxidase I  sequences. Phylogenetic analysis of these lineages suggests that they arose at  approximately the same time. The geographical distribution of some lineages  coincides with areas that were islands during the Pliocene. Overall, hierarchical  AMOVA analysis shows that chromosomal races and Pliocene islands describe only  28% and 24%, respectively, of the total current mtDNA variation. However,  removing one widespread (A) and one putatively introgressed (F) lineage increases  these estimates to 65% and 80%, respectively. Intraspecific sequence divergence  was very high, reaching a maximum of 9.5% (uncorrected distance) and GC content  was high compared to other insect mtDNA sequences. Average corrected distance  among mtDNA lineages supports the Pliocene origins of this level of genetic  diversity. In the southern part of the species range there is reduced mtDNA  variation, probably related to local extinction of H. thoracica populations from  recent volcanic activity and subsequent re-colonization from a leading edge. In  contrast, in this southern part there are five chromosome races, suggesting that  chromosome races here may be younger than those in the north.

TI Colonisation and extinction in relation to competition and resource partitioning
SO Folia parasitologica
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB This paper challenges two paradigms long held in relation to the ecology of  parasites in freshwater systems: (1) autogenic species are poorer colonisers than  allogenic ones; and (2) parasites with direct life cycles are more successful  colonisers than those with complex life cycles. Using new and existing data for  Acanthocephala in freshwater fish from the British Isles, it is suggested that  all six species present have been able to colonise and persist successfully, in  spite of the supposed limitations of their autogenic life-style. It is proposed  that these parasites have overcome these limitations by a variety of means, which  apply equally to all species considered. Foremost among these is the utilisation  of a migratory fish host as either a preferred or a suitable host in their life  cycle, allowing colonisation of new areas and rescue effects in established  areas, whilst equally important is the use of a common and widespread crustacean  as the intermediate host. In addition, all six species appear to exhibit resource  partitioning by host at either or both the larval and adult stages, thus reducing  the potential for competition and further facilitating colonisation and survival.  This hypothesis is supported by data from previous studies both on  acanthocephalans from Europe and North America and on other autogenic parasites.  It also provides an explanation for the apparently atypical host utilisation  patterns of some acanthocephalan species in areas on the edge of their  distributions, notably in Ireland.

AB The problem of biological invasion in a model single-species community is  considered, the spatiotemporal dynamics of the system being described by a  modified Fisher equation. For a special case, we obtain an exact solution  describing self-similar growth of the initially inhabited domain. By comparison  with numerical solutions, we show that this exact solution may be applicable to  describe an early stage of a biological invasion preceding the propagation of the  stationary travelling wave. Also, the exact solution is applied to the problem of  critical aggregation to derive sufficient conditions of population extinction.  Finally, we show that the solution we obtain is in agreement with some data from  field observations.

TI Parasite adaptation to extreme conditions in a desert environment.
SO Parasitology
LA English
DT Review
AB Deserts represent universally recognized extreme environments for animal life.  This paper documents the highly specialized adaptations of Pseudodiplorchis  americanus, a monogenean parasite of the desert toad, Scaphiopus couchii.  Building on a long-term record of parasite population ecology (continuing since  the early 1980s), field studies focus on the effects of severe drought in the  Sonoran Desert, Arizona, in the mid 1990s. This provides a test of the ability of  the host-parasite system to tolerate exceptional perturbation. The analysis  provides new insight into parasite infection dynamics in a natural wildlife  system through integration of host and parasite population age structure. The  environmental check interrupted host recruitment in 1993-95 and parasite  recruitment in 1995-97. This produced an imprint in age structure and infection  levels recognizable over several years: parasite recruitment failure reduced  transmission 2-3 years later. The host (maximum life span 17 years) tolerated the  disruption but the impact was more serious for the parasite (life span 3 years)  leading to extinction of some previously stable populations. Despite this  demonstration of a rare event exacerbating external environmental constraints,  experimental studies suggest that the internal (host) environment normally  creates the most severe conditions affecting P. americanus. Only about 3% of  parasites survive from invasion until first reproduction. Post-invasion factors  including host immunity, characteristic of most parasite life cycles, constitute  a greater constraint upon survival than external conditions, even in a desert  environment.

TI Experimental evolution in Heterandria formosa, a livebearing fish: group
SO Genetical research
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB Group selection has historically been an important and controversial subject in  evolutionary biology. There is now a compelling body of evidence, both  theoretical and experimental, that group selection not only can be effective, but  can be effective in situations when individual selection is not. However,  experiments in which true population-level traits have been shown to evolve in  response to group selection are currently limited to two species of flour beetle  in the genus Tribolium and RNA viruses. Here we report the results of an  experiment wherein we imposed group selection via differential extinction for  increased and decreased population size at 6-week intervals, a true  population-level trait, in the poeciliid fish Heterandria formosa. In contrast to  most other group selection experiments, we observed no evolutionary response  after six rounds of group selection in either the up- or down-selected lines.  Populational heritability for population size was low, if not actually negative.  Our results suggest that group selection via differential extinction may be  effective only if population sizes are very small and/or migration rates are low.

TI A model of Gambian sleeping sickness with open vector populations.
SO IMA journal of mathematics applied in medicine and biology
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB A compartmental model of Gambian sleeping sickness is described that takes into  account density-dependent migratory flows of infected flies. Equilibrium and  stability theorems are given which show that with a basic reproduction number R0  below unity, then in the absence of reinvasion the disease goes to extinction.  However, even a low prevalence rate among reinvading flies can then bring about  significant equilibrium prevalence rates among humans. For a set of realistic  parameter values we show that even in the case of a virulent parasite that keeps  infected individuals in the first stage for as little as 4 or 8 months (durations  for which there would be extinction with no infected reinvading flies) there is a  prevalence rate in the range 13.0-36.9%, depending on whether 1 or 2% of  reinvading flies are infected. A rate of convergence of the population dynamics  is introduced and is interpreted in terms of a halving time of the infected  population. It is argued that the persistence and/or extension of Gambian  sleeping sickness foci could be due either to a continuous reinvasion of infected  flies or to slow dynamics.

DE NASA Discipline Exobiology; Non-NASA Center
AB Over the last 15 years a striking pattern of diversification has been documented  in the fossil record of benthic marine invertebrates. Higher taxa (orders) tend  to originate onshore, diversify offshore, and retreat into deep-water  environments. Previous studies attribute this macroevolutionary pattern to a  variety of causes, foremost among them the role of nearshore disturbance in  providing opportunities for the evolution of novel forms accorded ordinal rank.  Our analysis of the post-Paleozoic record of ordinal first appearances indicates  that the onshore preference of ordinal origination occurred only in the Mesozoic  prior to the Turonian stage of the Cretaceous, a period characterized by  relatively frequent anoxic/dysoxic bottom conditions in deeper marine  environments. Later, in the Cretaceous and Cenozoic, ordinal origination of  benthic organisms did not occur exclusively, or even preferentially, in onshore  environments. This change in environmental pattern of ordinal origination roughly  correlates with Late Cretaceous: (i) decline in anoxia/dysoxia in offshore  benthic environments; (ii) extinction of faunas associated with dysoxic  conditions; (iii) increase in bioturbation with the expansion of deep burrowing  forms into offshore environments; and (iv) offshore expansion of bryozoan  diversity. We also advance a separate argument that the Cenomanian/Turonian and  latest Paleocene global events eliminated much of the deep-water benthos. This  requires a more recent origin of modern vent and deep-sea faunas, from shallower  water refugia, than the Paleozoic or early Mesozoic origin of these faunas  suggested by other workers.

SO Evolution; international journal of organic evolution

DT Journal Article
AB We incorporate a representation of Plasmodium falciparum recombination within a  discrete-event model of malaria transmission. We simulate the introduction of a  new parasite genotype into a human population in which another genotype has  reached equilibrium prevalence and compare the emergence and persistence of the  novel recombinant forms under differing cross-reactivity relationships between  the genotypes. Cross-reactivity between the parental (initial and introduced)  genotypes reduces the frequency of appearance of recombinants within three years  of introduction from 100% to 14%, and delays their appearance by more than a  year, on average. Cross-reactivity between parental and recombinant genotypes  reduces the frequency of appearance to 36% and increases the probability of  recombinant extinction following appearance from 0% to 83%. When a recombinant is  cross-reactive with its parental types, its probability of extinction is  influenced by cross-reactivity between the parental types in the opposite manner;  that is, its probability of extinction after appearance decreases. Frequencies of  P. falciparum outcrossing are mediated by frequencies of mixed-genotype  infections in the host population, which are in turn mediated by the structure of  cross-reactivity between parasite genotypes. The three leading hypotheses about  how meiosis relates to oocyst production lead to quantitative, but no  qualitative, differences in these results.

TI Multiple attractors and boundary crises in a tri-trophic food chain.
SO Mathematical biosciences
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB The asymptotic behaviour of a model of a tri-trophic food chain in the chemostat  is analysed in detail. The Monod growth model is used for all trophic levels,  yielding a non-linear dynamical system of four ordinary differential equations.  Mass conservation makes it possible to reduce the dimension by 1 for the study of  the asymptotic dynamic behaviour. The intersections of the orbits with a Poincar√©  plane, after the transient has died out, yield a two-dimensional Poincar√©  next-return map. When chaotic behaviour occurs, all image points of this  next-return map appear to lie close to a single curve in the intersection plane.  This motivated the study of a one-dimensional bi-modal, non-invertible map of  which the graph resembles this curve. We will show that the bifurcation structure  of the food chain model can be understood in terms of the local and global  bifurcations of this one-dimensional map. Homoclinic and heteroclinic connecting  orbits and their global bifurcations are discussed also by relating them to their  counterparts for a two-dimensional map which is invertible like the next-return  map. In the global bifurcations two homoclinic or two heteroclinic orbits collide  and disappear. In the food chain model two attractors coexist; a stable limit  cycle where the top-predator is absent and an interior attractor. In addition  there is a saddle cycle. The stable manifold of this limit cycle forms the basin  boundary of the interior attractor. We will show that this boundary has a  complicated structure when there are heteroclinic orbits from a saddle  equilibrium to this saddle limit cycle. A homoclinic bifurcation to a saddle  limit cycle will be associated with a boundary crisis where the chaotic attractor  disappears suddenly when a bifurcation parameter is varied. Thus, similar to a  tangent local bifurcation for equilibria or limit cycles, this homoclinic global  bifurcation marks a region in the parameter space where the top-predator goes  extinct. The 'Paradox of Enrichment' says that increasing the concentration of  nutrient input can cause destabilization of the otherwise stable interior  equilibrium of a bi-trophic food chain. For a tri-trophic food chain enrichment  of the environment can even lead to extinction of the highest trophic level.

TI On the need for another type of predictive model in structured foods.
SO International journal of food microbiology
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB Most of the models discussed up till now in predictive microbiology do not take  into account the variability of microbial growth with respect to space. In  structured (solid) foods, microbial growth can strongly depend on the position in  the food and the assumption of homogeneity can thus not be accepted: space must  be considered as an independent variable. Indeed, experimental evidence exists of  bacteria competition on agar not showing the same behavior as the competition in  a well-mixed liquid culture system. It is conjectured that this is due to the  spatially structured habitat. Therefore, in the current paper, a prototype two  species competition model proposed in previous work by the authors is extended to  take space into account. The extended model describes two phenomena: (i) local  evolution of biomass and (ii) transfer of biomass through the medium. The  structure of the food product is taken into account by limiting the diffusion  through the medium. The smaller mobility of the micro-organisms in solid foods  allows spatial segregation which causes pattern formation. Evidence is given for  the fact that taking space into account indeed has an influence on the behavior  (coexistence/extinction) of the populations. Although the reported simulations  are by no means to be interpreted as accurate predictions, the proposed model  structure allows one to highlight (i) important characteristics of microbial  growth in structured foods and (ii) future research trends in predictive  microbiology.

The environmental constraints  undergoing human modification include levels of soil nitrogen, phosphorus,  calcium and pH, atmospheric CO(2), herbivore, pathogen, and predator densities,  disturbance regimes, and climate. Extinction would occur because the  physiologies, morphologies, and life histories of plants limit each species to  being a superior competitor for a particular combination of environmental  constraints. Changes in these constraints would favor a few species that would  competitively displace many other species from a region. In the long-term, the  "weedy" taxa that became the dominants of the novel conditions imposed by global  change should become the progenitors of a series of new species that are  progressively less weedy and better adapted to the new conditions. The relative  importance of evolutionary versus community ecology responses to global  environmental change would depend on the extent of regional and local recruitment  limitation, and on whether the suite of human-imposed constraints were novel just  regionally or on continental or global scales.

AB A 34-amino-acid peptide has been chemically synthesized based on a sequence from  human alpha-fetoprotein. The purified peptide is active in anti-growth assays  when freshly prepared in pH 7.4 buffer at 0.20 g/l, but this peptide slowly  becomes inactive. This functional change is proven by mass spectrometry to be  triggered by the formation of an intrapeptide disulfide bond between the two  cysteine residues on the peptide. Interpeptide cross-linking does not occur. The  active and inactive forms of the peptide have almost identical secondary  structures as shown by circular dichroism (CD). Zinc ions bind to the active  peptide and completely prevents formation of the inactive form. Cobalt(II) ions  also bind to the peptide, and the UV-Vis absorption spectrum of the  cobalt-peptide complex shows that: (1) a near-UV sulfur-to-metal-ion  charge-transfer band had a molar extinction coefficient consistent with two  thiolate bonds to Co(II); (2) the lowest-energy visible d-d transition maximum at  659 nm, also, demonstrated that the two cysteine residues are ligands for the  metal ion; (3) the d-d molar extinction coefficient showed that the metal  ion-ligand complex was in a distorted tetrahedral symmetry. The peptide has two  cysteines, and it is speculated that the other two metal ion ligands might be the  two histidines. The Zn(II)- and Co(II)-peptide complexes had similar peptide  conformations as indicated by their ultraviolet CD spectra, which differed very  slightly from that of the free peptide. Surprisingly, the cobalt ions acted in  the reverse of the zinc ions in that, instead of stabilizing anti-growth form of  the peptide, they catalyzed its loss. Metal ion control of peptide function is a  saliently interesting concept. Calcium ions, in the conditions studied,  apparently do not bind to the peptide. Trifluoroethanol and temperature (60  degrees C) affected the secondary structure of the peptide, and the peptide was  found capable of assuming various conformations in solution. This conformational  flexibility may possibly be related to the biological activity of the peptide.

DT Journal Article
AB PURPOSE: To examine whether changes in the effective doubling time of tumor cells  during irradiation of head-and-neck cancer are linked to accumulating dose.  METHODS AND MATERIALS: Optimal fitting of the results of four apparently  iso-effective regimens in three recently reported randomized controlled trials  (continuous hyperfractionated accelerated radiation therapy [CHART], Radiation  Therapy Oncology Group [RTOG] 90-03, and Trans-Tasman Radiation Oncology Group  [TROG] 91.01) was attempted using two different types of model of the change in  effective doubling time that may occur during treatment. The first involved the  traditional approach where doubling time changes at specific times after the  start of treatment regardless of fractionation used (''fixed response time''  models). The second is where changes in doubling time are linked to accumulating  biologic dose (''cellular depletion'' models). RESULTS: Changes in effective  doubling time occur during radiotherapy for head-and-neck cancer. Data from the  three trials can be fitted successfully by functions that imply a continuous  reduction in effective doubling time. Models linking the reductions in effective  doubling time to the cellular depletion that occurs in the tumor during  radiotherapy fit the data satisfactorily. Effective doubling time ultimately  reduces to 2 days, or slightly less, during high-dose radiotherapy regimens  designed to cure squamous head-and-neck cancer. CONCLUSIONS: If the assumption of  iso-effectivity is justified then this study indicates that the ''repopulation  phenomenon'' may be best described by a function that depicts a reduction in  effective tumor cell doubling time that decreases continuously during treatment  down to a certain minimum value. Furthermore, this reduction may be linked to  cellular depletion.

TI Parametric analysis of the ratio-dependent predator-prey model.
SO Journal of mathematical biology
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB We present a complete parametric analysis of stability properties and dynamic  regimes of an ODE model in which the functional response is a function of the  ratio of prey and predator abundances. We show the existence of eight  qualitatively different types of system behaviors realized for various parameter  values. In particular, there exist areas of coexistence (which may be steady or  oscillating), areas in which both populations become extinct, and areas of  "conditional coexistence" depending on the initial values. One of the main  mathematical features of ratio-dependent models, distinguishing this class from  other predator-prey models, is that the Origin is a complicated equilibrium  point, whose characteristics crucially determine the main properties of the  model. This is the first demonstration of this phenomenon in an ecological model.  The model is investigated with methods of the qualitative theory of ODEs and the  theory of bifurcations. The biological relevance of the mathematical results is  discussed both regarding conservation issues (for which coexistence is desired)  and biological control (for which extinction is desired).

TI Lessons from the past: biotic recoveries from mass extinctions.
SO Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB Although mass extinctions probably account for the disappearance of less than 5%  of all extinct species, the evolutionary opportunities they have created have had  a disproportionate effect on the history of life. Theoretical considerations and  simulations have suggested that the empty niches created by a mass extinction  should refill rapidly after extinction ameliorates. Under logistic models, this  biotic rebound should be exponential, slowing as the environmental carrying  capacity is approached. Empirical studies reveal a more complex dynamic,  including positive feedback and an exponential growth phase during recoveries.  Far from a model of refilling ecospace, mass extinctions appear to cause a  collapse of ecospace, which must be rebuilt during recovery. Other generalities  include the absence of a clear correlation between the magnitude of extinction  and the pace of recovery or the resulting ecological and evolutionary disruption  the presence of a survival interval, with few originations, immediately after an  extinction and preceding the recovery phase, and the presence of many lineages  that persist through an extinction event only to disappear during the subsequent  recovery. Several recoveries include numerous missing lineages, groups that are  found before the extinction, then latter in the recovery, but are missing during  the initial survival-recovery phase. The limited biogeographic studies of  recoveries suggest considerable variability between regions.

TI The evolution of Ty1-copia group retrotransposons in gymnosperms.
SO Molecular biology and evolution
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB A diverse collection of Ty1-copia group retrotransposons has been characterized  from the genome of Picea abies (Norway spruce) by degenerate PCR amplification of  a region of the reverse transcriptase gene. The occurrence of these  retrotransposable elements in the gymnosperms was investigated by Southern blot  hybridization analysis. The distribution of the different retrotransposons across  the gymnosperms varies greatly. All of the retrotransposon clones isolated are  highly conserved within the Picea (spruce) genus, many are also present in Pinus  (pine) and/or Abies (fir) genera, and some share strongly homologous sequences  with one or more of cedar, larch, Sequoia, cypress, and Ginkgo. Further subclones  of one of the most strongly conserved retrotransposon sequences, Tpa28, were  obtained from Ginkgo and P. abies. Comparisons of individual sequence pairs  between the two species show nucleotide cross-homologies of around 80%-85%,  corresponding to nucleotide substitution rates similar to those of nuclear  protein-coding genes. Analysis of Tpa28 consensus sequences reveals that strong  purifying selection has acted on this retrotransposon in the lineages connecting  Ginkgo and Picea. Collectively, these data suggest, first, that the evolution of  the Ty1-copia retrotransposon group in the gymnosperms is dominated by germ line  vertical transmission, with strong selection for reverse transcriptase sequence,  and, second, that extinction of individual retrotransposon types has been  comparatively rare in gymnosperm species lineages compared with angiosperms. If  this very high level of sequence conservation is a general property of the  retrotransposons, then their extreme sequence diversity implies that they are  extremely ancient, and the major element lineages seen today may have arisen  early in eukaryote evolution. The data are also consistent with horizontal  transmission of particular retrotransposons between species, but such a mechanism  is unnecessary to explain the results.

TI Analytical approaches to measuring cospeciation of host and parasites: through a
SO International journal for parasitology
LA English
DT Review
AB Studies of cophylogenetic associations between hosts and parasites have become  increasingly common. Historically, congruence between host and parasite  phylogenies has been seen as evidence for cospeciation. Analyses of such  coevolutionary relationships, however, are made extremely difficult by the  complex interplay of cospeciation, host switching, sorting (extinction),  duplication (intrahost speciation) and inertia (lack of parasite speciation)  events, all of which may produce incongruence between host and parasite  phylogenies. Here we review several methods of analysing cospeciation. We  illustrate these methods with an example from a Procellariiformes (seabird) and  chewing louse (Halipeurus) association.

SO Environmental research
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB This study was undertaken to determine whether variations in concentrations of  particulates in the ambient air of Montreal, Quebec, during the period 1984 to  1993, were associated with daily variations in cause-specific daily mortality.  Fixed-site air pollution monitors in Montreal provided daily mean levels of  various measures of particles and gaseous pollutants. Total sulfate was also  measured daily (1986-1993) at a monitoring station 150 km southeast of the city  (Sutton, Quebec). We used coefficient of haze (COH), extinction coefficient, and  sulfate from the Sutton station to predict fine particles and sulfate from fine  particles for days that were missing. We estimated associations between  cause-specific mortality and PM(2.5), PM(10), predicted fine particles and fine  sulfate particles, total suspended particles, coefficient of haze, extinction  coefficient, and total sulfate measured at the Sutton station. We selected a set  of underlying causes of death, as recorded on the death certificates, as the  endpoint and then regressed the logarithm of daily counts of cause-specific  mortality on the daily mean levels for the above measures of particulates, after  accounting for seasonal and subseasonal fluctuations in the mortality time  series, non-Poisson dispersion, weather variables, and gaseous pollutants. We  found positive and statistically significant associations between the daily  measures of ambient particle mass and sulfate mass and the deaths from  respiratory diseases and diabetes. The mean percentage change in daily mortality  (MPC), evaluated at the interquartile range for pollutants averaged over the day  of death and the preceding 2 days, for deaths from respiratory diseases was  MPC(COH)=6.90% (95% CI: 3.69-10.21%), MPC(Predicted PM2.5)= 9.03% (95% CI: 5.83-  12.33%), and MPC(Sutton sulfate)=4.64% (95% CI: 2.46-6.86%). For diabetes, the  corresponding estimates were MPC(COH)=7.50% (95% CI: 1.96-13.34%), MPC(Predicted  PM2.5)=7.59% (95% CI: 2.36-13.09%), and MPC(Sutton sulfate)=4.48% (95% CI:  1.08-7.99%). Among individuals older than 65 years at time of death, we found  consistent associations across our metrics of particles for neoplasms and  coronary artery diseases. Associations with sulfate mass were also found among  elderly persons who died of cardiovascular diseases and of lung cancer. These  associations were consistent with linear relationships. The associations found  for respiratory diseases and for cardiovascular diseases, especially in the  elderly, are in line with some of the current hypotheses regarding mechanisms by  which ambient particles may increase daily mortality. The positive associations  found for cancer and for diabetes may be understood through a general hypothesis  proposed by Frank and Tankersley, who suggested that persons in failing health  may be at higher risk for external insults through the failure of regulating  physiological set points. The association with diabetes may be interpreted in  light of recent toxicological findings that inhalation of urban particles in  animals increases blood pressure and plasmatic levels of endothelins that enhance  vasoconstriction and alter electrophysiology. Further research to confirm these  findings and to determine whether they are causal is warranted.

TI Increased thermohaline stratification as a possible cause for an ocean anoxic
SO Nature
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB Ocean anoxic events were periods of high carbon burial that led to drawdown of  atmospheric carbon dioxide, lowering of bottom-water oxygen concentrations and,  in many cases, significant biological extinction. Most ocean anoxic events are  thought to be caused by high productivity and export of carbon from surface  waters which is then preserved in organic-rich sediments, known as black shales.  But the factors that triggered some of these events remain uncertain. Here we  present stable isotope data from a mid-Cretaceous ocean anoxic event that  occurred 112 Myr ago, and that point to increased thermohaline stratification as  the probable cause. Ocean anoxic event 1b is associated with an increase in  surface-water temperatures and runoff that led to decreased bottom-water  formation and elevated carbon burial in the restricted basins of the western  Tethys and North Atlantic. This event is in many ways similar to that which led  to the more recent Plio-Pleistocene Mediterranean sapropels, but the greater  geographical extent and longer duration (approximately 46 kyr) of ocean anoxic  event 1b suggest that processes leading to such ocean anoxic events in the North  Atlantic and western Tethys were able to act over a much larger region, and  sequester far more carbon, than any of the Quaternary sapropels.

From the full ecosystem the  method extracts the minimal information to describe the long-term dynamics of  that population by a stochastic logistic system. The method is applied to a  one-predator-two-prey model.

TI Lessons from the past: evolutionary impacts of mass extinctions.
SO Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB Mass extinctions have played many evolutionary roles, involving differential  survivorship or selectivity of taxa and traits, the disruption or preservation of  evolutionary trends and ecosystem organization, and the promotion of taxonomic  and morphological diversifications-often along unexpected trajectories-after the  destruction or marginalization of once-dominant clades. The fossil record  suggests that survivorship during mass extinctions is not strictly random, but it  often fails to coincide with factors promoting survival during times of low  extinction intensity. Although of very serious concern, present-day extinctions  have not yet achieved the intensities seen in the Big Five mass extinctions of  the geologic past, which each removed > or =50% of the subset of relatively  abundant marine invertebrate genera. The best comparisons for predictive purposes  therefore will involve factors such as differential extinction intensities among  regions, clades, and functional groups, rules governing postextinction biotic  interchanges and evolutionary dynamics, and analyses of the factors that cause  taxa and evolutionary trends to continue unabated, to suffer setbacks but resume  along the same trajectory, to survive only to fall into a marginal role or  disappear ("dead clade walking"), or to undergo a burst of diversification. These  issues need to be addressed in a spatially explicit framework, because the fossil  record suggests regional differences in postextinction diversification dynamics  and biotic interchanges. Postextinction diversifications lag far behind the  initial taxonomic and morphological impoverishment and homogenization; they do  not simply reoccupy vacated adaptive peaks, but explore opportunities as opened  and constrained by intrinsic biotic factors and the ecological and evolutionary  context of the radiation.

TI Necessary and sufficient conditions for evolutionary suicide.
SO Bulletin of mathematical biology
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB Evolutionary suicide is an evolutionary process where a viable population adapts  in such a way that it can no longer persist. It has already been found that a  discontinuous transition to extinction is a necessary condition for suicide. Here  we present necessary and sufficient conditions, concerning the bifurcation point,  for suicide to occur. Evolutionary suicide has been found in structured  metapopulation models. Here we show that suicide can occur also in unstructured  population models. Moreover, a structured model does not guarantee the  possibility of suicide: we show that suicide cannot occur in age-structured  population models of the Gurtin-MacCamy type. The point is that the mutant's  fitness must explicitly depend not only on the environmental interaction  variable, but also on the resident strategy.

TI Phylogeography and regional endemism of a passively dispersing zooplankter:
SO Proceedings. Biological sciences
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB We investigated the phylogeography of the salt water rotifer Brachionus  plicatilis, a cyclical parthenogen with passive dispersal mechanisms, using  resting eggs recovered from saline lake sediments. Individual resting eggs were  obtained from a large selection of lakes which were representative of five  endorheic basins and the chain of coastal ponds in the Iberian Peninsula. The  novel use of resting eggs allows the integration of seasonal and annual  variations as well as the impact of stochastic effects such as drift and local  extinction. A 653 bp fragment of the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase subunit I  (COI) gene was sequenced from 98 eggs. Our results revealed a deep  phylogeographical structure in this species, with a division into two main  lineages with distinct geographical distributions, which probably diverged at the  beginning of the Pleistocene period. Most of the mitochondrial DNA haplotypes  were restricted to single lakes. Nested clade analysis supported Early  Pleistocene fragmentation of populations, low gene flow and some long-distance  colonization. These conclusions contrast strongly with previous ideas on rotifer  biogeography and this pattern is consistent with a recolonization of the Iberian  Peninsula from two glacial refugia. The results provide new insights into the  processes responsible for the genetic diversification of passive dispersers, a  life-history trait typical of zooplanktonic biotas.

TI Human fear conditioning is related to dopaminergic and serotonergic biological
SO Behavioral neuroscience
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB Biological markers for acquisition and extinction of fear conditioning were  studied in 40 individuals selected for displaying either good or poor acquisition  of fear conditioning. as estimated by the skin conductance response. Participants  with a short serotonin transporter (5-HTT) promoter allele or low monoamine  oxidase activity in platelets (trbc-MAO) displayed better acquisition than those  with only long alleles or high trbc-MAO, whereas participants with a long  dopamine D4 receptor (D4DR) exon III allele showed delayed extinction compared  with those with only short alleles. The findings, that D4DR exon III and 5-HTT  promoter genotypes and trbc-MAO activity are related to human fear conditioning,  a basic form of associative learning, are consistent with animal studies  suggesting a genetic contribution to fear conditioning. The authors suggest that  in humans these genetic mechanisms are partly dopaminergic and serotonergic in  origin.

AB The end-Triassic mass extinction is one of the five most catastrophic in  Phanerozoic Earth history. Here we report carbon isotope evidence of a pronounced  productivity collapse at the boundary, coincident with a sudden extinction among  marine plankton, from stratigraphic sections on the Queen Charlotte Islands,  British Columbia, Canada. This signal is similar to (though smaller than) the  carbon isotope excursions associated with the Permian-Triassic and  Cretaceous-Tertiary events.

TI Habitat structure and population persistence in an experimental community.
SO Nature
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB Understanding spatial population dynamics is fundamental for many questions in  ecology and conservation. Many theoretical mechanisms have been proposed whereby  spatial structure can promote population persistence, in particular for  exploiter-victim systems (host-parasite/pathogen, predator-prey) whose  interactions are inherently oscillatory and therefore prone to extinction of  local populations. Experiments have confirmed that spatial structure can extend  persistence, but it has rarely been possible to identify the specific mechanisms  involved. Here we use a model-based approach to identify the effects of spatial  population processes in experimental systems of bean plants (Phaseolus lunatus),  herbivorous mites (Tetranychus urticae) and predatory mites (Phytoseiulus  persimilis). On isolated plants, and in a spatially undivided experimental system  of 90 plants, prey and predator populations collapsed; however, introducing  habitat structure allowed long-term persistence. Using mechanistic models, we  determine that spatial population structure did not contribute to persistence,  and spatially explicit models are not needed. Rather, habitat structure reduced  the success of predators at locating prey outbreaks, allowing between-plant  asynchrony of local population cycles due to random colonization events.

TI Intein spread and extinction in evolution.
SO Trends in genetics : TIG
LA English
DT Review
AB Inteins are selfish DNA elements found within coding regions. They are translated  with their host protein, but then catalyze their own excision and the formation  of a peptide bond between their flanking protein regions. Understanding what  drives and selects inteins is relevant for assessing whether they have  unidentified biological functions and whether they can invade and become  established in new genes and organisms. Inteins are suggested to have been  present and more common in the progenitors of eukaryotes and prokaryotes. In  these cells, inteins had some beneficial function or had evolved from an unknown  beneficial protein. Since then, this putative benefit has been lost and inteins  are gradually becoming extinct. The proteins in which inteins are currently found  are proposed to be proteins vital for the survival of the organism, where intein  removal is most difficult.

TI A new Triassic procolophonoid reptile and its implications for procolophonoid
SO Proceedings. Biological sciences
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB A reptile specimen from the Lystrosaurus Assemblage Zone of the Beaufort Group,  lowermost Triassic of South Africa, represents a new procolophonoid parareptile.  Sauropareion anoplus gen. et sp. nov. is identified as the sister taxon of  Procolophonidae in a phylogenetic analysis of procolophonoids. Stratigraphic  calibration of the most parsimonious tree reveals that four of the six  procolophonoid lineages originating in the Permian Period extended into the  succeeding Triassic Period. This relatively high taxic survivorship (67%) across  the Permo-Triassic boundary strongly suggests that procolophonoids were little if  at all affected by the mass extinction event that punctuated the end of the  Palaeozoic Era (ca. 251 million years ago).

TI Avian evolution, Gondwana biogeography and the Cretaceous-Tertiary mass
SO Proceedings. Biological sciences
LA English
DT Review
AB The fossil record has been used to support the origin and radiation of modern  birds (Neornithes) in Laurasia after the Cretaceous-Tertiary mass extinction  event, whereas molecular clocks have suggested a Cretaceous origin for most avian  orders. These alternative views of neornithine evolution are examined using an  independent set of evidence, namely phylogenetic relationships and historical  biogeography. Pylogenetic relationships of basal lineages of neornithines,  including ratite birds and their allies (Palaleocognathae), galliforms and  anseriforms (Galloanserae), as well as lineages of the more advanced Neoves  (Gruiformes, (Capimulgiformes, Passeriformes and others) demonstrate pervasive  trans-Antarctic distribution patterns. The temporal history of the neornithines  can be inferred from fossil taxa and the ages of vicariance events, and along  with their biogeographical patterns, leads to the conclusion that neornithines  arose in Gondwana prior to the Cretaceous Tertiary extinction event.

TI The current biodiversity extinction event: scenarios for mitigation and recovery.
SO Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB The current massive degradation of habitat and extinction of species is taking  place on a catastrophically short timescale, and their effects will fundamentally  reset the future evolution of the planet's biota. The fossil record suggests that  recovery of global ecosystems has required millions or even tens of millions of  years. Thus, intervention by humans, the very agents of the current environmental  crisis, is required for any possibility of short-term recovery or maintenance of  the biota. Many current recovery efforts have deficiencies, including  insufficient information on the diversity and distribution of species, ecological  processes, and magnitude and interaction of threats to biodiversity (pollution,  overharvesting, climate change, disruption of biogeochemical cycles, introduced  or invasive species, habitat loss and fragmentation through land use, disruption  of community structure in habitats, and others). A much greater and more urgently  applied investment to address these deficiencies is obviously warranted.  Conservation and restoration in human-dominated ecosystems must strengthen  connections between human activities, such as agricultural or harvesting  practices, and relevant research generated in the biological, earth, and  atmospheric sciences. Certain threats to biodiversity require intensive  international cooperation and input from the scientific community to mitigate  their harmful effects, including climate change and alteration of global  biogeochemical cycles. In a world already transformed by human activity, the  connection between humans and the ecosystems they depend on must frame any  strategy for the recovery of the biota.

TI Chaos and population disappearances in simple ecological models.
SO Journal of mathematical biology
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB A class of truncated unimodal discrete-time single species models for which low  or high densities result in extinction in the following generation are  considered. A classification of the dynamics of these maps into five types is  proven: (i) extinction in finite time for all initial densities, (ii)  semistability in which all orbits tend toward the origin or a semistable fixed  point, (iii) bistability for which the origin and an interval bounded away from  the origin are attracting, (iv) chaotic semistability in which there is an  interval of chaotic dynamics whose compliment lies in the origin's basin of  attraction and (v) essential extinction in which almost every (but not every)  initial population density leads to extinction in finite time. Applying these  results to the Logistic, Ricker and generalized Beverton-Holt maps with constant  harvesting rates, two birfurcations are shown to lead to sudden population  disappearances: a saddle node bifurcation corresponding to a transition from  bistability to extinction and a chaotic blue sky catastrophe corresponding to a  transition from bistability to essential extinction.

AB Several attempts have been made at the removal of specific pathogens from the  intestinal microflora using either bacteriophages or "predatory" bacteria such as  Bdellovibrio spp. To date these attempts have had mixed success. A mechanism  explaining these findings based on competitive hindrance by non-prey, or decoy  species is put forward. It is shown that this hindrance tends to damp out  predator-prey oscillations, and therefore reduces the probability of prey  extinction. Possible experiments to verify this theory are discussed. The decoy  effect may play a role in any system with high densities of bacteria or other  particulate matter, such as activated sludge or biofilms.

SO Journal of mathematical biology
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB Ecological interactions between species that prefer different habitat types but  come into contact in edge regions at the interfaces between habitat types are  modeled via reaction-diffusion systems. The primary sort of interaction described  by the models is competition mediated by pathogen transmission. The models are  somewhat novel because the spatial domains for the variables describing the  population densities of the interacting species overlap but do not coincide.  Conditions implying coexistence of the two species or the extinction of one  species are derived. The conditions involve the principal eigenvalues of elliptic  operators arising from linearizations of the model system around equilibria with  only one species present. The conditions for persistence or extinction are made  explicit in terms of the parameters of the system and the geometry of the  underlying spatial domains via estimates of the principal eigenvalues. The  implications of the models with respect to conservation and refuge design are  discussed.

TI Coexistence induced by pollen limitation in flowering-plant species.
SO Proceedings. Biological sciences
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB We report a novel mechanism for species coexistence that does not invoke a  trade-off relationship in the case of outbreeding flowering plants. Competition  for pollination services may lead to interspecific segregation of the timing of  flowering among plants. This, in turn, sets limits on the pollination services,  which restrain the population growth of a competitively superior species, thereby  allowing an inferior species to sustain its population in the habitat. This  explains the often-observed tendency for interspecific differentiation in the  timing of flowering between coexisting plants. It also predicts that the  introduction of an efficient pollinator to a habitat may cause the extinction of  competitively inferior plant species.

AB Characterizing the solution structure of protein-polymer conjugates and  protein-ligand interactions is important in fields such as biotechnology and  biochemistry. Size-exclusion high-performance liquid chromatography with online  classical light scattering (LS), refractive index (RI), and UV detection offers a  powerful tool in such characterization. Novel methods are presented utilizing LS,  RI, and UV signals to rapidly determine the degree of conjugation and the  molecular mass of the protein conjugate. Baseline resolution of the  chromatographic peaks is not required; peaks need only be sufficiently separated  to represent relatively pure fractions. An improved technique for determining the  polypeptide-only mass of protein conjugates is also described. These techniques  are applied to determining the degree of erythropoietin glycosylation, the degree  of polyethylene glycol conjugation to RNase A and brain-derived neurotrophic  factor, and the solution association states of these molecules. Calibration  methods for the RI, UV, and LS detectors will also be addressed, as well as  online methods to determine protein extinction coefficients and dn/dc values both  unconjugated and conjugated protein molecules.

TI Arbovirus infection increases with group size.
SO Proceedings. Biological sciences
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB Buggy Creek (BCR) virus is an arthropod-borne alphavirus that is naturally  transmitted to its vertebrate host the cliff swallow (Petrochelidon pyrrhonota)  by an invertebrate vector, namely the cimicid swallow bug (Oeciacus vicarius). We  examined how the prevalence of the virus varied with the group size of both its  vector and host. The study was conducted in southwestern Nebraska where cliff  swallows breed in colonies ranging from one to 3700 nests and the bug populations  at a site vary directly with the cliff swallow colony size. The percentage of  cliff swallow nests containing bugs infected with BCR virus increased  significantly with colony size at a site in the current year and at the site in  the previous year. This result could not be explained by differences in the bug  sampling methods, date of sampling, sample size of the bugs, age structure of the  bugs or the presence of an alternate host, the house sparrow (Passer domesticus).  Colony sites that were reused by cliff swallows showed a positive autocorrelation  in the percentage of nests with infected bugs between year t and year t+1, but  the spatial autocorrelation broke down for year t+2. The increased prevalence of  BCR virus at larger cliff swallow colonies probably reflects the larger bug  populations there, which are less likely to decline in size and lead to virus  extinction. To the authors' knowledge this is the first demonstration of  arbovirus infection increasing with group size and one of the few known  predictive ecological relationships between an arbovirus and its vectors/hosts.  The results have implications for both understanding the fitness consequences of  coloniality for cliff swallows and understanding the temporal and spatial  variation in arboviral epidemics.

AB Since its proposition in 1995, the Heumann-H√∂tzel model has remained as an  obscure model of biological aging. The main arguments used against it were its  apparent inability to describe populations with many age intervals and its  failure to prevent a population extinction when only deleterious mutations are  present. We find that with a simple and minor change in the model these  difficulties can be surmounted. Our numerical simulations show a plethora of  interesting features: the catastrophic senescence, the Gompertz law and that  postponing the reproduction increases the survival probability, as has already  been experimentally confirmed for the drosophila fly.

TI The extinction program for Homo sapiens and cloning humans: trinucleotide
SO Medical hypotheses
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB It has been uncovered that expansion of trinucleotide repeats in the human genome  are causing a variety of genetic diseases. They are also identified in other loci  that are not clearly related to particular diseases, which indicates such repeat  expansion is one of the general forms of evolution occurring throughout the human  genome. Trinucleotide repeat expansion has been shown to occur during meiosis,  and is generally irreversible. In consequence, every human chromosome suffers  from the burden of accumulating trinucleotide repeats along with the passage of  generation, which eventually ends up in a deficiency of replication. Thus, all  the human chromosomes are predicted to be 'mortal', so far as they replicate  through meiosis. Naturally, the mortality of human chromosomes leads to the  mortality of Homo sapiens as a species on earth. Although it is quite  controversial, a radical breakthrough for humans to survive might be found  through cloning reproduction without meiosis.

SO Journal of mathematical biology

DT Journal Article
AB In this paper, single-species nonautonomous dispersal models with delays are  considered. An interesting result on the effect of dispersal for persistence and  extinction is obtained. That is, if the species is persistent in a patch then it  is also persistent in all other patches; if the species is permanent in a patch  then it is also permanent in all other patches; if the species is extinct in a  patch then it is also extinct in all other patches. Furthermore, some new  sufficient conditions for the permanence and extinction of the species in a patch  are established. The existence of positive periodic solutions is obtained in the  periodic case by employing Teng and Chen's results on the existence of positive  periodic solutions for functional differential equations.

TI Approximating the long-term behaviour of a model for parasitic infection.
SO Journal of mathematical biology
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB In a companion paper two stochastic models, useful for the initial behaviour of a  parasitic infection, were introduced. Now we analyse the long term behaviour.  First a law of large numbers is proved which allows us to analyse the  deterministic analogues of the stochastic models. The behaviour of the  deterministic models is analogous to the stochastic models in that again three  basic reproduction ratios are necessary to fully describe the information needed  to separate growth from extinction. The existence of stationary solutions is  shown in the deterministic models, which can be used as a justification for  simulation of quasi-equilibria in the stochastic models. Host-mortality is  included in all models. The proofs involve martingale and coupling methods.

TI Are certain life histories particularly prone to local extinction?
SO Journal of theoretical biology
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB Using stochastic simulations and elasticity analysis, we show that there are  inherent differences in the risk of extinction between life histories with  different demographies. Which life history is the most vulnerable depends on  which vital rate varies. When juvenile survival varies semelparous organisms with  delayed reproduction are the most vulnerable ones, while a varying developmental  rate puts a greater threat to semelparous organisms with rapid development.  Iteroparous organisms are the most vulnerable ones when adult survival varies.  Generally, we do not expect to observe organisms in nature having variation in  vital rates that produce a high risk of extinction. Given the results here we  therefore predict that iteroparous organisms should show low variation in adult  survival. Moreover, we predict that semelparous organisms should show low  variation in juvenile survival and low variation in developmental rate. The  effect of temporal correlation on extinction risk is most pronounced in organisms  with semelparous life histories.

TI Dynamic colloid--water partitioning of pyrene through a coastal Baltic spring
SO Environmental science & technology
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB Colloidal organic particles constitute the dominant portion of particulate  organic matter in surface seawater, but their influence on the phase speciation  and bioavailability of hydrophobic organic compounds (HOCs) is sparsely  evaluated. Studies on colloid-water partitioning have been focused on other  regimes and have largely been performed on chemically defined subportions of  total colloids such as the humic fraction. Available estimates of colloid-water  partition coefficients (Kcoc) are highly variable and not easily explained by  regularly applied Kow-Koc relationships. Here, pyrene was partitioned to bulk  natural colloids isolated using cross-flow ultrafiltration techniques from the  surface water of a coastal bay. A key objective was to elucidate biogeochemical  controls on the changing colloid-sorbent qualities over the course of the dynamic  allochtonous-autochtonous transition of a well-constrained boreal coastal spring  bloom. The pyrene Kcoc was found to decrease from 12.9+/-0.9 x 10(3) Lw/kg(oc) in  the terrestrial runoff dominated regime to values around 2.9+/-0.7 x 10(3)  Lw/kg(oc), once phytoplankton production became the governing source of organic  matter to the surface waters. The changing Kcoc was well correlated with the  molar extinction coefficient at 280 nm of the colloidal organic carbon. This  study supports other reports of an improved prediction of HOC phase speciation  through this simple molecular proxy of the "quality" of organic sorbents. While  being poor sorbents on a carbon atom basis, relative to soils and sediments,  coastal marine colloids, by their shear abundance, may significantly attenuate  the truly dissolved exposures of HOCs with log Kow above 5.

TI Complexity and fragility in ecological networks.
SO Proceedings. Biological sciences

DT Journal Article
AB A detailed analysis of three species-rich ecosystem food webs has shown that they  display skewed distributions of connections. Such graphs of interaction are, in  fact, shared by a number of biological and technological networks, which have  been shown to display a very high homeostasis against random removals of nodes.  Here, we analyse the responses of these ecological graphs to both random and  selective perturbations (directed against the most-connected species). Our  results suggest that ecological networks are very robust against random removals  but can be extremely fragile when selective attacks are used. These observations  have important consequences for biodiversity dynamics and conservation issues,  current estimations of extinction rates and the relevance and definition of  keystone species.

TI Centrifuge polarizing microscope. I. Rationale, design and instrument
SO Journal of microscopy

DT Review
AB We first describe early uses of the centrifuge for deciphering physical  properties and molecular organization within living cells, as well as the  development and use of centrifuge microscopes for such studies. The rationale for  developing a centrifuge microscope that allows high-extinction polarized light  microscopy to observe dynamic fine structures in living cells is next discussed.  We then describe a centrifuge polarizing microscope (CPM) that we developed for  observing fine structural changes in living cells which are being exposed to up  to approximately 11 500 times earth's gravitational field (g). With the specimen  housed in a rotor supported on an air spindle motor, and imaged through an  external microscope illuminated by a precisely synchronized flash of less than 10  ns duration from a Nd:YAG laser, the image of the spinning object remains steady  up to the maximum speed of 11 700 rev min-1, or up to approximately 11 500 x g.  The image is captured, at up to 25 frames s-1, by an interference-fringe-free CCD  camera that is synchronized to the centrifuge rotor. At all speeds (in 100 rev  min-1 increments), the image is resolved to better than 1 microm, while  birefringence of the specimen, housed in a specially designed specimen chamber  that suffers low-stress birefringence and prevents leakage of the physiological  solutions, is detected with a retardance sensitivity of better than 1 nm.  Differential interference contrast and fluorescence images (532 nm excitation) of  the spinning specimen can also be generated with the CPM. The second part of this  study (Inou√© et al., J. Microsc. 201 (2001) 357-367, describes several biological  applications of the CPM that we have explored. Individual live cells, such as  oocytes and blood cells, are supported on a sucrose or Percoll density gradient  while other cells, such as cultured fibroblasts and Dictyostelium amoebae, are  observed crawling on glass surfaces. Observations of these cells exposed to the  high G fields (centripetal acceleration/g) in the CPM are yielding many new  results that lead to intriguing questions regarding the organization and function  of fine structures in living cells and related quasi-fluid systems.

TI Extinctions in the random replicator model.
SO Physical review. E, Statistical, nonlinear, and soft matter physics
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB The statistical properties of an ecosystem composed of species interacting via  pairwise, random interactions and deterministic, concentration limiting  self-interactions are studied analytically with tools of equilibrium statistical  mechanics of disordered systems. Emphasis is given to the effects of externally  induced extinction of a fixed fraction of species at the outset of the  evolutionary process. The manner the ecosystem copes with the initial extinction  event depends on the degree of competition among the species as well as on the  strength of that event. For instance, in the regime of high competition the  ecosystem diversity, given by the fraction of surviving species, is practically  insensitive to the strength of the initial extinction provided it is not too  large, while in the less competitive regime the diversity decreases linearly with  the size of the event. In the case of large extinction events we find that no  further biotic extinctions take place and, furthermore, that rare species become  very unlikely to be found in the ecosystem at equilibrium. In addition, we show  that the reciprocal of the Edwards-Anderson order parameter yields a good measure  of the diversity of the model ecosystem.

We report burial ages for megafauna from 28 sites and infer  extinction across the continent around 46,400 years ago (95% confidence interval,  51,200 to 39,800 years ago). Our results rule out extreme aridity at the Last  Glacial Maximum as the cause of extinction, but not other climatic impacts; a  "blitzkrieg" model of human-induced extinction; or an extended period of  anthropogenic ecosystem disruption.

TI Dansyl and dabsyl analytical constructs as tools for the accurate estimation of
SO Journal of combinatorial chemistry

DT Journal Article
AB The presence of dansyl or dabsyl chromogenic moieties in a solid-phase analytical  construct, an assembly of linkers/spacers/sensitizers for improving analytical  characterization, allows the accurate estimation of products from solid-phase  synthesis by UV detection during liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis  in the cleavage solution. The spectroscopic properties of dansylated molecules  have been evaluated to verify the "compound-independent UV absorption" necessary  for using the chromophore in the accurate estimation. First, measurements on  commercial dansylated compounds were made, then a series of construct-like  molecules were prepared by solution-phase synthetic procedures and their UV  properties were determined. Compound calibration curves were determined, and UV  absorption was shown to be both proportional to the compound concentration and  compound-independent. An example of a dansyl construct derivative was then  prepared on a polymeric matrix, and an accurate estimation using the calibration  curves was carried out in the cleavage solution. Good agreement was found between  the calculated amount of released compound using the UV calibration curves and  the calculated amount using both (1)H NMR and LC/chemiluminescent nitrogen  detection quantitative techniques. Preliminary studies using the dabsyl moiety as  an improved chromophore with higher wavelength and extinction coefficient are  also reported.

TI Noradrenaline in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis is critical for
SO European journal of pharmacology
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB The effect of noradrenaline in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis and locus  coeruleus on maintenance and reactivation of morphine-conditioned place  preference induced by footshock stress was investigated in rats. After receiving  alternate injection of morphine (10 mg/kg) and saline for 6 consecutive days, the  rats spent more time in the drug-paired compartment (morphine-conditioned place  preference) on day 7. These animals did not show morphine-conditioned place  preference on day 37 following sham-footshock once every 3 days from days 8 to 36  (28 days drug-free). However, 15 min of intermittent footshock once every 3 days  could induce the maintenance of morphine-conditioned place preference on day 37  with significantly more time spent in the drug-paired compartment than on day 0.  Microinjection of the alpha(2)-adrenoceptor agonist, clonidine (0.1 or 1 microg),  into the locus coeruleus 30 min before footshock did not affect stress-induced  maintenance of conditioned place preference. However, infusions of clonidine (1  microg) into the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis significantly attenuated the  maintenance of conditioned place preference induced by footshock stress. In  another experiment, after a 21-day extinction of morphine-conditioned place  preference, a single footshock could reactivate the morphine place preference  that was significantly blocked by pretreatment with infusion of clonidine (0.1 or  1 microg) into the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis but not the locus  coeruleus. Reactivation of morphine-conditioned place preference elicited by  footshock stress was significantly inhibited by 6-hydroxydopamine-induced lesions  in the ventral noradrenergic bundle, most of the norepinephrine input to the bed  nucleus of the stria terminalis arising from caudal brain stem noradrenergic cell  groups. In contrast, chemical lesions of the dorsal noradrenergic bundle that  arises from the locus coeruleus had no such effects. These findings suggest that  noradrenergic neurons in locus coeruleus are not involved in stress-induced  reinstatement of drug-seeking and further clearly demonstrate that noradrenaline  in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis plays a critical role in mediating  this effect. Comprehension of the neurochemical events underlying the  stress-induced and the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis-mediated reinstatement  of drug-seeking may, therefore, throw more light on the biological bases of drug  dependence and addictive behavior

TI Multiple comparison of entropies with application to dinosaur biodiversity.
SO Biometrics
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB Did the biodiversity of dinosaurs decline, or did it remain more or less constant  before their mass extinction 65 million years ago? Sheehan et al. (1991, Science,  835-839) reported that the biodiversity of families of dinosaur species remained  more or less constant preceding their extinction, suggesting extinction due to a  cataclysmic event such as an asteroid strike. But that claim was based on the  incorrect interpretation that a large p value associated with a test of null  hypothesis of equality supports that null hypothesis. To assess whether there is  a basis for such a claim, we formulate the problem as one of practical  equivalence, in analalogy to bioequivalence. We then develop reliable practical  equivalence confidence intervals for differences of entropies by applying the  bootstrap-t technique to a nearly pivotal quantity. Confidence intervals for  changes in the biodiversity of dinosaurs are then computed, allowing the reader  to assess whether there is evidence of near constancy of dinosaur biodiversity  before extinction.

TI High incidence of a male-specific genetic marker in phenotypic female chinook
SO Environmental health perspectives
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB Numerous populations of anadromous salmonids in the northwestern United States  have been declining for many years, resulting in Endangered Species Act listings  and in some cases extinction. The degradation of river ecosystems has been  proposed as one of the major reasons for the inability of salmon to maintain  their populations. However, the specific factors interfering with the  reproduction and survival of salmon during the freshwater phase of their life  cycle have not been fully described. This study was initiated to determine the  incidence of phenotypic sex reversal in wild, fall chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus  tshawytcha) that returned to spawn in the Columbia River. Fish were sampled at  different locations within this watershed to determine whether they were  faithfully expressing their genotype. We report a high incidence (84%) of a  genetic marker for the Y chromosome in phenotypic females sampled from the wild,  which was not observed in female fish raised in hatcheries. It appears likely  that female salmon with a male genotype have been sex reversed, creating the  potential for an abnormal YY genotype in the wild that would produce all-male  offspring and alter sex ratios significantly.

TI Plague dynamics and population genetics of the desert locust: can turnover during
SO Molecular ecology
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB The desert locust (Schistocerca gregaria) undergoes crowding-induced phase  transformation from solitary form to gregarious form. The transformations  involves changes in behaviour, colour, development, morphometry, fecundity and  endocrine physiology. Recession populations of the desert locust exist primarily  in the solitary phase as small populations in patchy environments and are prone  to extinction because of climatic events. Significant genetic differentiation  among recession populations along the Red Sea coast of Eritrea was previously  reported. It was hypothesized that despite the mixing effect of recurrent swarms,  metapopulation dynamics could have produced genetic divergence among these highly  scattered recession populations. A Monte Carlo simulation of the population  dynamics of the desert locust in a metapopulation setting, with a realistic range  of parameter values clearly demonstrated that this is possible. Population growth  was represented by a discrete-time logistic equation. The duration of recessions  and swarms was sampled from normal distributions whose means and standard  deviations were varied based on reported estimates. An average recession duration  of 10 +/- 3 generations and swarm periods half as long but almost twice as  variable produced a partitioning of the total genetic variance most similar to  that in the empirical study. In conventional metapopulation analysis, whether  turnover leads to increased or reduced divergence is dependent on the number of  colonists relative to the number of recurrent migrants, and on whether the  colonists arise from a single patch or many patches. In the case of locusts, the  stochastic boom and bust cycle is the overriding factor. Divergence between  patches during recession due to founder effect and recurrent drift is balanced by  the high rate of mixing during plagues.

TI The evolutionary life history of P transposons: from horizontal invaders to
SO Chromosoma
LA English
DT Review
AB P elements, a family of DNA transposons, are known as aggressive intruders into  the hitherto uninfected gene pool of Drosophila melanogaster. Invading through  horizontal transmission from an external source they managed to spread rapidly  through natural populations within a few decades. Owing to their propensity for  rapid propagation within genomes as well as within populations, they are  considered as the classic example of selfish DNA, causing havoc in a genomic  environment permissive for transpositional activity. Tracing the fate of P  transposons on an evolutionary scale we describe different stages in their  evolutionary life history. Starting from horizontal transfer events, which now  appear to be rather a common phenomenon, the initial transpositional burst in the  new host is slowed down by the accumulation of defective copies as well as  host-directed epigenetic silencing. This leads to the loss of mobility and,  finally, to molecular erosion by random mutations. Possible escape routes from  genomic extinction are the reactivation within the original host genome by  recombination or suspension of the repressing regime, horizontal emigration to a  virgin gene pool, or genomic integration and acquisition of a novel function as a  domesticated host gene.

TI N-methyl-D-aspartate channel and consciousness: from signal coincidence detection
SO Progress in neurobiology
LA English
DT Review
AB Research on Blindsight, Neglect/Extinction and Phantom limb syndromes, as well as  electrical measurements of mammalian brain activity, have suggested the  dependence of vivid perception on both incoming sensory information at primary  sensory cortex and reentrant information from associative cortex. Coherence  between incoming and reentrant signals seems to be a necessary condition for  (conscious) perception. General reticular activating system and local electrical  synchronization are some of the tools used by the brain to establish coarse  coherence at the sensory cortex, upon which biochemical processes are  coordinated. Besides electrical synchrony and chemical modulation at the synapse,  a central mechanism supporting such a coherence is the N-methyl-D-aspartate  channel, working as a 'coincidence detector' for an incoming signal causing the  depolarization necessary to remove Mg(2+), and reentrant information releasing  the glutamate that finally prompts Ca(2+) entry. We propose that a signal  transduction pathway activated by Ca(2+) entry into cortical neurons is in charge  of triggering a quantum computational process that accelerates inter-neuronal  communication, thus solving systemic conflict and supporting the unity of  consciousness.

TI Stochastic epidemics in dynamic populations: quasi-stationarity and extinction.
SO Journal of mathematical biology
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB Empirical evidence shows that childhood diseases persist in large communities  whereas in smaller communities the epidemic goes extinct (and is later  reintroduced by immigration). The present paper treats a stochastic model  describing the spread of an infectious disease giving life-long immunity, in a  community where individuals die and new individuals are born. The time to  extinction of the disease starting in quasi-stationarity (conditional on  non-extinction) is exponentially distributed. As the population size grows the  epidemic process converges to a diffusion process. Properties of the limiting  diffusion are used to obtain an approximate expression for tau, the  mean-parameter in the exponential distribution of the time to extinction for the  finite population. The expression is used to study how tau depends on the  community size but also on certain properties of the disease/community: the basic  reproduction number and the means and variances of the latency period, infectious  period and life-length. Effects of introducing a vaccination program are also  discussed as is the notion of the critical community size, defined as the size  which distinguishes between the two qualitatively different behaviours.

TI An evolutionary-game model of tumour-cell interactions: possible relevance to
SO European journal of cancer (Oxford, England : 1990)
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB Evolutionary games have been applied as simple mathematical models of populations  where interactions between individuals control the dynamics. Recently, it has  been proposed to use this type of model to describe the evolution of tumour cell  populations with interactions between cells. We extent the analysis to allow for  synergistic effects between cells. A mathematical model of a tumour cell  population is presented in which population-level synergy is assumed to originate  through the interaction of triplets of cells. A threshold of two cooperating  cells is assumed to be required to produce a proliferative advantage. The  mathematical behaviour of this model is explored. Even this simple synergism  (minor clustering effect) is sufficient to generate qualitatively different  cell-population dynamics from the models published previously. The most notable  feature of the model is the existence of an unstable internal equilibrium  separating two stable equilibria. Thus, cells of a malignant phenotype can exist  in a stable polymorphism, but may be driven to extinction by relatively modest  perturbations of their relative frequency. The proposed model has some features  that may be of interest to biological interpretations of gene therapy. Two  prototypical strategies for gene therapy are suggested, both of them leading to  extinction of the malignant phenotype: one approach would be to reduce the  relative proportion of the cooperating malignant cell type below a certain  critical value. Another approach would be to increase the critical threshold  value without reducing the relative frequency of cells of the malignant  phenotype.

TI Absolute diversification rates in angiosperm clades.
SO Evolution; international journal of organic evolution
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB The extraordinary contemporary species richness and ecological predominance of  flowering plants (angiosperms) are even more remarkable when considering the  relatively recent onset of their evolutionary diversification. We examine the  evolutionary diversification of angiosperms and the observed differential  distribution of species in angiosperm clades by estimating the rate of  diversification for angiosperms as a whole and for a large set of angiosperm  clades. We also identify angiosperm clades with a standing diversity that is  either much higher or lower than expected, given the estimated background  diversification rate. Recognition of angiosperm clades, the phylogenetic  relationships among them, and their taxonomic composition are based on an  empirical compilation of primary phylogenetic studies. By making an integrative  and critical use of the paleobotanical record, we obtain reasonably secure  approximations for the age of a large set of angiosperm clades. Diversification  was modeled as a stochastic, time-homogeneous birth-and-death process that  depends on the diversification rate (r) and the relative extinction rate  (epsilon). A statistical analysis of the birth and death process was then used to  obtain 95% confidence intervals for the expected number of species through time  in a clade that diversifies at a rate equal to that of angiosperms as a whole.  Confidence intervals were obtained for stem group and for crown group ages in the  absence of extinction (e = 0.0) and under a high relative extinction rate  (epsilon = 0.9). The standing diversity of angiosperm clades was then compared to  expected species diversity according to the background rate of diversification,  and, depending on their placement with respect to the calculated confidence  intervals, exceedingly species-rich or exceedingly species-poor clades were  identified. The rate of diversification for angiosperms as a whole ranges from  0.077 (epsilon = 0.9) to 0.089 (epsilon = 0.0) net speciation events per million  years. Ten clades fall above the confidence intervals of expected species  diversity, and 13 clades were found to be unexpectedly species poor. The  phylogenetic distribution of clades with an exceedingly high number of species  suggests that traits that confer high rates of diversification evolved  independently in different instances and do not characterize the angiosperms as a  whole.

A novel state due to fluctuation  and discreteness in molecular numbers is found, characterized as an extinction of  molecule species alternately in the autocatalytic reaction loop. Phase transition  to this state with changes of the system size and flow is studied, while a  single-molecule switch of the molecule distributions is reported.

TI Analysis of parasite host-switching: limitations on the use of phylogenies.
SO Parasitology
LA English
DT Review
AB Even the most generalist parasites usually occur in only a subset of potential  host species, a tendency which reflects overriding environmental constraints on  their distributions in nature. The periodic shifting of these limitations  represented by host-switches may have been an important process in the evolution  of many host-parasite assemblages. To study such events, however, it must first  be established where and when they have occurred. Past host-switches within a  group of parasites are usually inferred from a comparison of the parasite  phylogeny with that of the hosts. Congruence between the phylogenies is often  attributed to a history of association by descent with cospeciation, and  incongruence to host-switching or extinction in 'duplicated' parasite lineages  (which diverged without a corresponding branching of the host tree). The  inference of host-switching from incongruent patterns is discussed. Difficulties  arise because incongruence can frequently be explained by different combinations  of biologically distinct events whose relative probabilities are uncertain. Also,  the models of host-parasite relationships implicit in historical reconstructions  may often not allow for plausible sources of incongruence other than  host-switching or duplication/extinction, or for the possibility that  colonization could, in some circumstances, be disguised by 'false' congruence.

TI Androgens in human evolution. A new explanation of human evolution.
SO Rivista di biologia
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB Human evolution consists of chronological changes in gene regulation of a  continuous and relatively stable genome, activated by hormones, the production of  which is intermittently affected by endogenous and exogenous forces. Periodic  variations in the gonadal androgen, testosterone, and the adrenal androgen,  dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), significantly participated in all hominid  transformations. The hominid characteristics of early Australopithecines are  primarily a result of increased testosterone. The first significant cold of the  early Pleistocene resulted in an increase in DHEA that simultaneously produced  Homo and the robust Australopithecines. Subsequent Pleistocene climatic changes  and differential reproduction produced changes in DHEA and testosterone ratios  that caused extinction of the robust Australopithecines and further changes and  continuation of Homo. Changes in testosterone and DHEA produce allometric and  behavioral changes that are identifiable and vigorous in modern populations.

TI Disparity, decimation and the Cambrian "explosion": comparison of early Cambrian
SO Revista de biologia tropical
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB The controversy about a Cambrian "explosion" of morphological disparity (followed  by decimation), cladogenesis and fossilization is of central importance for the  history of life. This paper revisits the controversy (with emphasis in  onychophorans, which include emblematic organisms such as Hallucigenia), presents  new data about the Chengjiang (Cambrian of China) faunal community and compares  it and the Burgess Shale (Cambrian of Canada) with an ecologically similar but  modern tropical marine site where onychophorans are absent, and with a modern  neotropical terrestrial onychophoran community. Biovolume was estimated from  material collected in Costa Rica and morphometric measurements were made on  enlarged images of fossils. Cambrian tropical mudflats were characterized by the  adaptive radiation of two contrasting groups: the vagile arthropods and the  sessile poriferans. Arthropods were later replaced as the dominant benthic taxon  by polychaetes. Vagility and the exoskeleton may explain the success of  arthropods from the Cambrian to the modern marine and terrestrial communities,  both in population and biovolume. Food ecological displacement was apparent in  the B. Shale, but not in Chengjiang or the terrestrial community. When only hard  parts were preserved, marine and terrestrial fossil deposits of tropical origin  are even less representative than deposits produced by temperate taxa, Chengjiang  being an exception. Nutrient limitations might explain why deposit feeding is  less important in terrestrial onychophoran communities, where carnivory,  scavenging and omnivory (associated with high motility and life over the  substrate) became more important. Fossil morphometry supports the interpretation  of "lobopod animals" as onychophorans, whose abundance in Chengjiang was equal to  their abundance in modern communities. The extinction of marine onychophorans may  reflect domination of the infaunal habitat by polychaetes. We conclude that (1) a  mature ecological community structure was generalized during the Cambrian, and  even biodiversity and equitability indices were surprisingly close to modern  values; (2) the morphological diversity and geographic distribution of  onychophorans indicate a significant pre-Cambrian evolutionary history which does  not support the "explosion" hypothesis; (3) disparity among phyla was not as  important as the explosion-decimation model predicts, but in the case of  onychophorans, disparity within the phylum was greater than it is today and its  reduction may have been associated with migration into the sediment when large  predators evolved.

DT Journal Article
DE NASA Discipline Exobiology; Non-NASA Center
AB Experiments where the simple polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) naphthalene  (C10H8) is subjected to the energetic environment of a plasma have resulted in  the synthesis of a molecular aggregate that has ultraviolet spectral  characteristics that suggest it provides insight into the nature of the carrier  of the 2175 angstroms interstellar extinction feature and may be a laboratory  analog. Ultraviolet, visible, infrared, and mass spectroscopy, along with gas  chromatography, indicate that it is a molecular aggregate in which an aromatic  double ring ("naphthalene") structural base serves as the electron "box"  chromophore that gives rise to the envelope of the 2175 angstroms feature. This  chromophore can also provide the peak of the feature or function as a mantle in  concert with another peak provider such as graphite. The molecular  base/chromophore manifests itself both as a structural component of an  alkyl-aromatic polymer and as a substructure of hydrogenated PAH species. Its  spectral and molecular characteristics are consistent with what is generally  expected for a complex molecular aggregate that has a role as an interstellar  constituent.

The pattern of accumulation of species with time, estimated by genetic  divergence between island and source lineages, rejects a homogeneous model of  colonization and extinction. Rather, our results suggest an abrupt, roughly  10-fold increase in colonization rate or a 90% mass extinction event 0.55 to 0.75  million years ago.

TI Behavioral momentum and the law of effect.
SO The Behavioral and brain sciences
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB In the metaphor of behavioral momentum, the rate of a free operant in the  presence of a discriminative stimulus is analogous to the velocity of a moving  body, and resistance to change measures an aspect of behavior that is analogous  to its inertial mass. An extension of the metaphor suggests that preference  measures an analog to the gravitational mass of that body. The independent  functions relating resistance to change and preference to the conditions of  reinforcement may be construed as convergent measures of a single construct,  analogous to physical mass, that represents the effects of a history of exposure  to the signaled conditions of reinforcement and that unifies the traditionally  separate notions of the strength of learning and the value of incentives.  Research guided by the momentum metaphor encompasses the effects of reinforcement  on response rate, resistance to change, and preference and has implications for  clinical interventions, drug addiction, and self-control. In addition, its  principles can be seen as a modern, quantitative version of Thorndike's (1911)  Law of Effect, providing a new perspective on some of the challenges to his  postulation of strengthening by reinforcement.

AB Living creatures are under control of biological clocks with various periods near  those of environmental cycles. Examples are circadian (about a day) and  circannual (about a year) clocks. We may ask why their periods are not precisely  one day or one year because adaptation to the environment should then be easier.  Here, introducing a model of competitive population dynamics of biological  species with clock dynamics incorporated, it is shown that periods equal or close  to that of the environment do not always guarantee overwhelming superiority and  can even lead to extinction. This result may provide a clue to solve the mystery.

The  macroevolutionary history of diversity of cyclostome and cheilostome bryozoans is  consistent with a coupled-logistic model of clade displacement predicated on  species within clades interacting competitively. The model matches observed  diversity history if the model is perturbed by a mass extinction with a position  and magnitude analogous to the Cretaceous/Tertiary boundary event, Although it is  difficult to measure all parameters in the model from fossil data, critical  factors are intrinsic rates of extinction, which can be measured. Cyclostomes  maintained a rather low rate of extinction, and the model solutions predict that  they would lose diversity only slowly as competitively superior species of  cheilostomes diversified into their environment. Thus, the microecological record  of preserved competitive interactions between cyclostome and cheilostome  bryozoans and the macroevolutionary record of global diversity are consistent in  regard to competition as a significant influence on diversity histories of  post-Paleozoic bryozoans.

TI Oleamide modulates memory in rats.
SO Neuroscience letters
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB Oleamide is a recently described lipid, obtained from the cerebrospinal fluid of  sleep-deprived cats. It has been observed that oleamide possesses several  biological effects, such as sleep induction, and immunological suppression as  well as serotonin and gamma-aminobutyric acid receptors activation. In addition,  oleamide also binds to the cannabinoid receptors. In this study, we have observed  that oleamide facilitates memory extinction in a passive avoidance paradigm,  reduces core temperature and pain perception, but does not affect significantly  locomotion. These results suggest that oleamide modulates memory processes.  However, we do not know if oleamide impairs the retrieval of the memory  associated to the "not go" behavior, or facilitates the fast re-learning of the  "go" behavior. In addition, since these effects are also induced by marijuana and  anandamide, it is very likely that oleamide may be affecting the cerebral  cannabinoid system to induce its effects.

TI Golden eagles, feral pigs, and insular carnivores: how exotic species turn native
SO Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB Island ecosystems are particularly vulnerable to exotic species. Here we show how  an introduced prey has led to the wholesale restructuring of an island food web,  including the near extinction of an endemic carnivore. Introduced pigs, by  providing abundant food, enabled golden eagles to colonize the California Channel  Islands. Eagles preyed heavily on the island fox, whose resulting decline toward  extinction released populations of the competitively inferior island skunk. The  presence of exotic pigs led to major ecosystem shifts by indirectly causing  predation to replace competition as the dominant force shaping these island  communities.

AB Experiments in cats revealed a clear-cut dependence of the early complex (up to  100 msec) of evoked potentials recorded in the caudate nucleus and temporal  cortex on biological relevance of the stimulus (presence or absence of alimentary  signal), with constant physical parameters. The early complex of evoked  potentials can reflect activity of the mechanisms preventing non-specific motor  response to exteroceptive stimulus, although it does not exclude processing the  stimulus-carried information during generation of evoked potentials.

TI Synthetic heparin pentasaccharide depolymerization by heparinase I: molecular and
SO Clinical and applied thrombosis/hemostasis : official journal of the
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB A synthetic pentasaccharide (SR90107/ ORG31540) representing the antithrombin III  (ATIII) binding sequence in heparin is under clinical development for the  prophylaxis and management of venous thromboembolism. This pentasaccharide  exhibits potent anti-factor Xa (AXa) effects (>750 IU/mg) and does not exhibit  any anti-factor IIa (AIIa) activity. Previous reports have suggested that  synthetic heparin pentasaccharides are resistant to the digestive effects of  heparinase I. To investigate the effect of heparinase I on the AXa activity of  pentasaccharide SR90107/ORG31540, graded concentrations (1.25-100 microg/ml) were  incubated with a fixed amount of heparinase I (0.1 U/ml). Heparinase I produced a  strong neutralizing effect on this pentasaccharide, as measured by AXa activity.  This observation led to further studies where high performance liquid  chromatography (HPLC) analysis was employed to determine the potential breakdown  products of the pentasaccharide. The experiment with the pentasaccharide included  incubation (37 degrees C) at 1 mg/ml and exposure to graded concentrations of  heparinase I (0.125-1 U/ml). After 30 min of incubation, the enzymatic activity  was stopped by heat treatment and the mixture was analyzed using high performance  size exclusion chromatography (HPSEC). Heparinase I concentration-dependent  cleavage of the pentasaccharide was evident. The breakdown products exhibited a  mass of 1,034 d and 743 d, respectively, suggesting the generation of a  trisaccharide and a disaccharide moiety. The extinction of a disaccharide moiety  in the UV region was high, indicating the presence of a double bond in this  molecule. These data clearly suggest that pentasaccharide SR90107/ORG31540 is  digestible by heparinase I into its two components. Furthermore, these data  support the hypothesis that heparinase I can be used as a neutralizing agent for  pentasaccharide overdose. Additionally, a highly methylated analog of the  previously mentioned synthetic pentasaccharide. SanOrg34006, which has also been  subjected to similar experiments, has shown complete resistance to the  depolymerizing function of heparinase I; therefore, its use may be appropriate in  chronic situations as a long-acting form of the pentasaccharide.

TI Monophyly and extensive extinction of advanced eusocial bees: insights from an
SO Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB Advanced eusociality sometimes is given credit for the ecological success of  termites, ants, some wasps, and some bees. Comprehensive study of bees fossilized  in Baltic amber has revealed an unsuspected middle Eocene (ca. 45 million years  ago) diversity of eusocial bee lineages. Advanced eusociality arose once in the  bees with significant post-Eocene losses in diversity, leaving today only two  advanced eusocial tribes comprising less than 2% of the total bee diversity, a  trend analogous to that of hominid evolution. This pattern of changing diversity  contradicts notions concerning the role of eusociality for evolutionary success  in insects.
