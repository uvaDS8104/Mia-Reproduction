TI Determinants of loss of mammal species during the Late Quaternary 'megafauna'
SO Proceedings. Biological sciences
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB Extinctions of megafauna species during the Late Quaternary dramatically reduced  the global diversity of mammals. There is intense debate over the causes of these  extinctions, especially regarding the extent to which humans were involved. Most  previous analyses of this question have focused on chronologies of extinction and  on the archaeological evidence for human-megafauna interaction. Here, I take an  alternative approach: comparison of the biological traits of extinct species with  those of survivors. I use this to demonstrate two general features of the  selectivity of Late Quaternary mammal extinctions in Australia, Eurasia, the  Americas and Madagascar. First, large size was not directly related to risk of  extinction; rather, species with slow reproductive rates were at high risk  regardless of their body size. This finding rejects the 'blitzkrieg' model of  overkill, in which extinctions were completed during brief intervals of selective  hunting of large-bodied prey. Second, species that survived despite having low  reproductive rates typically occurred in closed habitats and many were arboreal  or nocturnal. Such traits would have reduced their exposure to direct interaction  with people. Therefore, although this analysis rejects blitzkrieg as a general  scenario for the mammal megafauna extinctions, it is consistent with extinctions  being due to interaction with human populations.

TI Faunal change, environmental variability and late Pliocene hominin evolution.
SO Journal of human evolution
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB Global change during the late Pliocene was manifested in declining temperatures,  increased amplitude of climate cycles, and shifts in the periodicity of orbital  climate forcing. Linking these changes to the evolution of African continental  faunas and to hominin evolution requires well-documented fossil evidence that can  be examined through substantial periods of time. The Omo sequence of southern  Ethiopia provides such a database, and we use it to analyze change in the  abundances of mammal taxa at different levels of temporal and taxonomic  resolution between 4 and 2 Ma. This study provides new evidence for shifts  through time in the ecological dominance of suids, cercopithecids, and bovids,  and for a trend from more forested to more open woodland habitats. Superimposed  on these long-term trends are two episodes of faunal change, one involving a  marked shift in the abundances of different taxa at about 2.8+/-0.1 Ma, and the  second the transition at 2.5 Ma from a 200-ka interval of faunal stability to  marked variability over intervals of about 100 ka. The first appearance of Homo,  the earliest artefacts, and the extinction of non-robust Australopithecus in the  Omo sequence coincide in time with the beginning of this period of high  variability. We conclude that climate change caused significant shifts in  vegetation in the Omo paleo-ecosystem and is a plausible explanation for the  gradual ecological change from forest to open woodland between 3.4 and 2.0 Ma,  the faunal shift at 2.8 +/-0.1 Ma, and the change in the tempo of faunal  variability of 2.5 Ma. Climate forcing in the late Pliocene is more clearly  indicated by population shifts within the Omo mammal community than by marked  turnover at the species level.

TI Transient dynamics in metapopulation response to perturbation.
SO Theoretical population biology
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB Transient time in population dynamics refers to the time it takes for a  population to return to population-dynamic equilibrium (or close to it) following  a perturbation in the environment or in population size. Depending on the  direction of the perturbation, transient time may either denote the time until  extinction (or until the population has decreased to a lower equilibrium level),  or the recovery time needed to reach a higher equilibrium level. In the  metapopulation context, the length of the transient time is set by the interplay  between population dynamics and landscape structure. Assuming a spatially  realistic metapopulation model, we show that transient time is a product of four  factors: the strength of the perturbation, the ratio between the metapopulation  capacity of the landscape and a threshold value determined by the properties of  the species, and the characteristic turnover rate of the species, adjusted by a  factor depending on the structure of the habitat patch network. Transient time is  longest following a large perturbation, for a species which is close to the  threshold for persistence, for a species with slow turnover, and in a habitat  patch network consisting of only a few dynamically important patches. We  demonstrate that the essential behaviour of the n-dimensional spatially realistic  Levins model is captured by the one-dimensional Levins model with appropriate  parameter transformations.

TI Identification of cysteine sulfenic acid in AhpC of alkyl hydroperoxide
SO Methods in enzymology
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB C165S AhpC in its sulfenate (Cys-SO-) and presumed thiolate (Cys-S-) forms at pH  7 (pKa for sulfenic acid about pH 6.1) exhibit low extinction absorbance bands  around 367 and 324 nm, respectively. Sulfenic acid content of the protein can be  assessed by its reactivity with the chromophoric TNB anion. Using this technique,  H2O2 titrations of C165S AhpC give a maximum of about 1 SOH per subunit on  addition of 1.0 to 1.2 equivalents of H2O2. Cys46-SO- is moderately air stable at  neutral pH and room temperature and is oxidized at a steady rate of about 10% per  half hour. Cys46-SO- of C165S AhpC is reduced in the presence of catalytic  amounts of AhpF by approximately 1 equivalent of NADH to regenerate the Cys46-S-  species. NBD chloride is extremely useful as a trapping agent for cysteine  sulfenic acid. The Cys46-S(O)-NBD adduct absorbs maximally at 347 nm and is 16  amu larger than the Cys46-S-NBD adduct (lambda max = 420 nm) as shown by ESI-MS.  Other electrophilic thiol reagents also react with Cys46-SO-; however,  iodoacetamide and N-ethylmaleimide reactivities are much lower with Cys46-SO-  than with Cys46-S-. These methods are applicable to other sulfenic  acid-containing proteins, although in some cases the proteins must be denatured  in order to provide accessibility of this species toward labeling agents.

TI Ecological risk-benefit analysis of a wetland development based on risk
SO Risk analysis : an official publication of the Society for Risk Analysis
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB Ecological risk from the development of a wetland is assessed quantitatively by  means of a new risk measure, expected loss of biodiversity (ELB). ELB is defined  as the weighted sum of the increments in the probabilities of extinction of the  species living in the wetland due to its loss. The weighting for a particular  species is calculated according to the length of the branch on the phylogenetic  tree that will be lost if the species becomes extinct. The length of the branch  on the phylogenetic tree is regarded as reflecting the extent of contribution of  the species to the taxonomic diversity of the world of living things. The  increments in the probabilities of extinction are calculated by a simulation used  for making the Red List for vascular plants in Japan. The resulting ELB for the  loss of Nakaikemi wetland is 9,200 years. This result is combined with the  economic costs for conservation of the wetland to produce a value for the  indicator of the "cost per unit of biodiversity saved." Depending on the  scenario, the value is 13,000 yen per year-ELB or 110,000 to 420,000 yen per  year-ELB (1 US dollar = 110 yen in 1999).

DE MESF value; emission spectrum matching; extinction coefficient; fluorescein; lymphocyte; microbead; pH; quantitative flow cytometry
AB The present work uses fluorescein as the model fluorophore and points out  critical steps in the use of MESF (Molecules of Equivalent Soluble Fluorophores)  values for quantitative flow cytometric measurements. It has been found that  emission spectrum matching between a reference solution and an analyte and  normalization by the corresponding extinction coefficient are required for  quantifying fluorescence signals using flow cytometers. Because of the use of  fluorescein, the pH value of the medium is also critical for accurate MESF  assignments. Given that the emission spectrum shapes of microbead suspensions and  stained biological cells are not significantly different, the percentage of error  due to spectrum mismatch is estimated. We have also found that the emission  spectrum of a microbead with a seven-methylene linker between the fluorescein and  the bead surface (bead7) provides the best match with the spectra from biological  cells. Therefore, bead7 is potentially a better calibration standard for flow  cytometers than the existing one that is commercially available and used in the  present study.

TI A cartilage derived novel compound DDP (2,6-dimethyldifuro-8-pyrone): isolation,
SO The Journal of rheumatology

DT Journal Article
AB OBJECTIVE: Fluorescent biomolecules within cartilage matrix can be used as  specific markers of cartilage metabolism. While establishing the protocol to  evaluate mature collagen crosslinks in articular cartilage (AC) associated with  maturation, aging, and osteoarthritis, chromatographic analysis of the crosslinks  also revealed an apparently novel fluorescent peak. Preliminary investigation of  this compound (now abbreviated DDP) in various tissues from rabbits, calves,  chickens, and humans showed that this compound is AC-specific. We aimed to  isolate, purify, and identify this fluorescent compound. METHODS: Fully  encapsulated, bovine metacarpophalangeal joints (n = 350, age < 2 years) were  used as the source for AC. DDP was isolated and purified by reverse phase high  pressure liquid chromatography, and its elution was monitored using a  fluorescence detector at excitation lambda = 306 nm, and emission lambda = 395  nm. The liquid phase of DDP was characterized by mass spectrometry and nuclear  magnetic resonance spectroscopy. DDP solution (5.7 microg/microl) was  crystallized in 100% deuterated methanol and the DDP crystal was characterized by  single crystal x-ray diffraction. RESULTS: From bulk preparations, 12 pg (58  nmol) per gram dried AC of the novel compound was isolated and purified.  Analytical techniques to identify this AC-specific compound,  2,6-dimethyldifuro-8-pyrone, corroborate and confirm its molecular structure and  atomic connectivity in both liquid and solid phase. DDP is a symmetrical aromatic  compound with molecular weight 204, molecular forrmula C11H8O4, and a molar  extinction coefficient 4,700 M(-1) at maximal UV absorption (lambda = 306 nm).  CONCLUSION: 2,6-dimethyldifuro-8-pyrone (DDP) is a novel cartilage-specific  compound that could have potential application as a unique biochemical marker in  joint diseases involving articular cartilage degradation.

SO Evolution; international journal of organic evolution

AB Population bottlenecks affect the dynamics of evolution, increasing the  probability that beneficial mutations will be lost. Recent protocols for the  experimental study of evolution involve repeated bottlenecks-when fresh media are  inoculated during serial transfer or when chemostat tubes are changed. Unlike  population reductions caused by stochastic environmental factors, these  bottlenecks occur at known, regular intervals and with a fixed dilution ratio. We  derive the ultimate probability of extinction for a beneficial mutation in a  periodically bottlenecked population, using both discrete and continuous  approaches. We show that both approaches yield the same approximation for  extinction probability. From this, we derive an approximate expression for an  effective population size.

TI [The parasite capacity of the host population].
SO Parazitologiia
LA rus
DT Journal Article
AB The estimation of parasitic pressure on the host populations is frequently  required in parasitological investigations. The empirical values of prevalence of  infection are used for this, however the latter one as an estimation of parasitic  pressure on the host population is insufficient. For example, the same prevalence  of infection can be insignificant for the population with high reproductive  potential and excessive for the population with the low reproductive potential.  Therefore the development of methods of an estimation of the parasitic pressure  on the population, which take into account the features the host population, is  necessary. Appropriate parameters are to be independent on view of the  researcher, have a clear biological sense and be based on easily available  characteristics. The methods of estimation of parasitic pressure on the host at  the organism level are based on various individual viability parameters:  longevity, resistance to difficult environment etc. The natural development of  this approach for population level is the analysis of viability parameters of  groups, namely, the changing of extinction probability of host population under  the influence of parasites. Obviously, some critical values of prevalence of  infection should exist; above theme the host population dies out. Therefore the  heaviest prevalence of infection, at which the probability of host population  size decreases during the some period is less than probability of that increases  or preserves, can serve as an indicator of permissible parasitic pressure on the  host population. For its designation the term "parasite capacity of the host  population" is proposed. The real parasitic pressure on the host population  should be estimated on the comparison with its parasite capacity. Parasite  capacity of the host population is the heaviest possible prevalence of infection,  at which, with the generation number T approaching infinity, there exists at  least one initial population size ni(0) for which the probability of size  decrease through T generations is less than the probability of its increase.  [formula: see text] The estimation of the probabilities of host population size  changes is necessary for the parasite capacity determination. The classical  methods for the estimation of extinction probability of population are unsuitable  in this case, as these methods require the knowledge of population growth rates  and their variances for all possible population sizes. Thus, the development  methods of estimate of extinction probability of population, based on the using  of available parameters (sex ratio, fecundity, mortality, prevalence of infection  PI) is necessary. The population size change can be considered as the Markov  process. The probabilities of all changes of population size for a generation in  this case are described by a matrix of transition probabilities of Markov process  (pi) with dimensions Nmax x Nmax (maximum population size). The probabilities of  all possible size changes for T generations can be calculated as pi T. Analyzing  the behaviour matrix of transition at various prevalence of infection, it is  possible to determine the parasite capacity of the host population. In  constructing of the matrix of transition probabilities, should to be taken into  account the features the host population and the influence of parasites on its  reproductive potential. The set of the possible population size at a generation  corresponds to each initial population size. The transition probabilities for the  possible population sizes at a generation can be approximated to the binomial  distribution. The possible population sizes at a generation nj(t + 1) can be  calculated as sums of the number of survived parents N1 and posterities N2; their  probabilities--as P(N1) x P(N2). The probabilities of equal sums N1 + N2 and nj(t  + 1) > or = Nmax are added. The number of survived parents N1 may range from 0 to  (1-PI) x ni(t). The survival probabilities can be estimated for each N1 as  [formula: see text] The number of survived posterities N2 may range from 0 to  N2max (the maximum number of posterities). N2max is [formula: see text] and the  survival probabilities for each N2, is defined as [formula: see text] where  [formula: see text], ni(t) is the initial population size (including of males and  infected specimens of host), PI is the prevalence of infection, Q1 is the  survival probabilities of parents, Pfemales is the frequency of females in the  host population, K is the number of posterities per a female, and Q2 is the  survival probabilities of posterities. When constructing matrix of transition  probabilities of Markov process (pi), the procedure outlined above should be  repeated for all possible initial population size. Matrix of transition  probabilities for T generations is defined as pi T. This matrix (pi T) embodies  all possible transition probabilities from the initial population sizes to the  final population sizes and contains a wealth of information by itself. From the  practical point of view, however, the plots of the probability of population size  decrease are more suitable for analysis. They can be received by summing the  probabilities within of lines of matrix from 0 to ni--1 (ni--the population size,  which corresponds to the line of the matrix). Offered parameter has the number of  advantages. Firstly, it is independent on a view of researcher. Secondly, it has  a clear biological sense--this is a limit of prevalence, which is safe for host  population. Thirdly, only available parameters are used in the calculation of  parasite capacity: population size, sex ratio, fecundity, mortality. Lastly, with  the availability of modern computers calculations do not make large labour.  Drawbacks of this parameter: 1. The assumption that prevalence of infection,  mortality, fecundity and sex ratio are constant in time (the situations are  possible when the variability of this parameters can not be neglected); 2. The  term "maximum population size" has no clear biological sense; 3. Objective  restrictions exist for applications of this mathematical approach for populations  with size, which exceeds 1000 specimens (huge quantity of computing  operations--order Nmax 3*(T-1), work with very low probabilities). The further  evolution of the proposed approach will allow to transfer from the probabilities  of size changes of individual populations to be probabilities of size changes of  population systems under the influence of parasites. This approach can be used at  the epidemiology and in the conservation biology.

TI Selection pressure towards monoxeny in Camallanus cotti (Nematoda, Camallanidac)
SO Parasitology
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB This paper describes the ability of the Asian fish nematode Camallanus cotti to  carry out both heteroxeny, i.e. an indirect life-cycle using copepods as  intermediate host, and monoxeny, i.e. direct infection and development in the  definitive fish host. C. cotti occurs naturally in various freshwater teleosts in  Asia. During the past decades it has been disseminated into closed or semi-closed  aquaculture systems and aquaria around the world, mainly due to the ornamental  fish trade. Under such conditions the species may frequently face a bottleneck  situation with regard to the availability of copepods. It is known that C. cotti  may reproduce and persist in copepod-free aquaria for several months. In order to  investigate whether C. cotti has selected towards monoxeny in water systems  lacking copepods, in contrast to the opposite selection pressure when copepods  are present, 2 separate infection trials were run. It was shown that the parasite  can infect the fish host both indirectly via copepods, and directly. However, C.  cotti has significantly higher fitness, expressed as survival to maturity, when  transmitted indirectly compared to the direct transmission mode. We suggest that  the ability of aquarium populations of C. cotti to carry out a direct life-cycle  is favoured by selection in order to avoid extinction whenever copepods are  absent. It still remains unknown, however, whether the parasite shows the same  characteristics in the wild.

AB The objective of this paper is to systematically study the qualitative properties  of a ratio-dependent one-prey two-predator model. We show that the dynamics  outcome of the interactions are very sensitive to parameter values and initial  data. Specifically, we show the interactions can lead to all the following  possible outcomes: 1). competitive exclusion; 2). total extinction, i.e.,  collapse of the whole system; 3). coexistence in the form of positive steady  state; 4). coexistence in the form of oscillatory solutions; and 5). introducing  a friendly and better competitor can save a otherwise doomed prey species. These  results reveal far richer dynamics compared to similar prey dependent models.  Biological implications of these results are discussed.

DT Review
AB Subjects with posttraumatic stress disorder exhibit abnormalities in many  psychobiological systems. Studies of the effects of stress on learning and memory  processes suggest that fear conditioning, behavioural sensitisation, and a  failure of extinction may be important in the persistence and reexperiencing of  traumatic memories and stress sensitivity. All these symptoms are supported by  specific biological mechanisms including NMDA receptors, noradrenergic system,  etc. Recent findings show that amino acid transmitters, glutamate and GABA, are  intimately involved in the process of factual memory registration, and suggest  that amine neurotransmitters, norepinephrine and serotonin, are involved in  encoding emotional memory. In addition, research suggests that 5-HT neurones have  directs effects on both adrenergic and HPA function. Such findings provide  important information that should guide current pharmacological practice and the  development of innovative biological therapeutics.

TI Evolutionarily stable leaf area production in plant populations.
SO Journal of theoretical biology
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB Using an analytical model, it was shown that for a given amount of nitrogen in  the canopy of a stand (N(T)), there exists an evolutionarily stable leaf area  index (ES-LAI), and therefore an evolutionarily stable average leaf nitrogen  content (n(ES)(av);n(ES)(av) =N(T)/ES-LAI), at which no individual plant in the  stand can increase its photosynthesis by changing its leaf area. It was also  shown that this ES-LAI is always greater than the optimal LAI that maximizes  photosynthesis per unit N(T) of the stand. This illustrates that the canopy  structure that maximizes photosynthesis of a population is not the same as the  canopy structure that maximizes photosynthesis of individuals within a  population. It was further derived that the ES-LAI at given N(T) increases with  the ratio between the light-saturated photosynthesis and the N content per unit  leaf area (leaf-PPNUE) and that it decreases with the canopy extinction  coefficient for light (K(L)), the light availability and the apparent quantum  yield (phi). These hypotheses were tested by comparing calculated ES-LAI and  n(ES)(av) values to actual LAIs and leaf N contents measured for stands of a  large variety of herbaceous plants. There was a close correspondence between the  calculated and measured values. As predicted by the model, plants with high  leaf-PPNUEs produced more leaf area per unit nitrogen than those with low  leaf-PPNUEs while plants with horizontal leaves, forming stands with higher K(L)  values, produced less leaf area than those with more vertically inclined leaves.  These results suggest that maximization of individual plant photosynthesis per  unit of nitrogen plays an important role in determining leaf area production of  plants and the resulting canopy structure of stands of vegetation. They further  suggest this optimization to be a mechanism by which leaf traits such as  leaf-PPNUE and leaf inclination angle are causally related to structural  characteristics of the population, i.e. the leaf area index of the stand.

TI Time-dependent extinction rate and species abundance in a tangled-nature model of
SO Physical review. E, Statistical, nonlinear, and soft matter physics
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB We present a model of evolutionary ecology consisting of a web of interacting  individuals, a tangle-nature model. The reproduction rate of individuals  characterized by their genome depends on the composition of the population in  genotype space. Ecological features such as the taxonomy and the  macroevolutionary mode of the dynamics are emergent properties. The macrodynamics  exhibit intermittent two-mode switching with a gradually decreasing extinction  rate. The generated ecologies become gradually better adapted as well as more  complex in a collective sense. The form of the species abundance curve compares  well with observed functional forms. The model's error threshold can be  understood in terms of the characteristics of the two dynamical modes of the  system.

TI Character release following extinction in a Caribbean reef coral species complex.
SO Evolution; international journal of organic evolution
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB The Pleistocene extinction of the widespread organ-pipe Montastraea coral had  measurable morphological and ecological effects on surviving lineages of the  Montastraea "annularis" species complex. Extinction of the organ-pipe Montastraea  occurred after more than 500,000 years of dominance in the shallow-water reef  habitat of Barbados. Extinction resulted in a morphological shift of the columnar  Montastraea lineage from thick to thin columns in modern reef environments.  Pleistocene colonies of the columnar morphotype sympatric with organ-pipe  Montastraea showed greater column widths than those in allopatry. We subjected  our data to a number of criteria for interpreting the morphological shift as  character release following lifting of competitive pressure after extinction. The  morphological differences do not appear to be due either to chance or to physical  properties of the marine environment. Differential local extinction and  recolonization of four members of the species complex did not occur on Barbados,  so that the species coexisted and appear to have coevolved between more than  600,000 and 82,000 years ago. The morphological shift is related to coral growth  form and growth rate, and thus reflects the acquisition of a primary resource in  corals--light. Character release occurred at the same oceanic Caribbean island  (Barbados) where environments have fluctuated with similar variance throughout  the period of coexistence. Not only has competition among living members of the  Montastraea "annularis" species complex been convincingly demonstrated, but  trends in relative abundance among fossil members of the species complex strongly  suggest that a competitive hierarchy was operating during their Pleistocene  coexistence on Barbados. We also observed an ecological analogue to character  release on another Caribbean island. Curaçao. The distribution and abundance of  living columnar M. annularis s.s. and massive M. faveolata from the leeward reef  crest in Curaçao is greater now than in the Pleistocene, when organ-pipe  Montastraea dominated this shallow-water reef habitat. Extinction of the faster  growing, shallow-water organ-pipe Montastraea resulted in higher abundance of the  columnar Montastraea lineage in shallow-water habitats, where it shifted its  morphology to one adapted to high light levels. The species extinction released  surviving lineages from a competitive network that had resulted in lower rank  abundance in the Pleistocene community and enhanced abundance of both columnar M.  annularis s.s. and M. faveolata in modern communities. Full validation of our  interpretation of character release must await experiments that demonstrate  whether phenotypic differences between populations have a genetic basis. However,  we believe the results of this study point to the important, yet heretofore  neglected, role that biological interactions have played in the evolution of  closely related reef coral species.

TI Locating the sources of an invasive pest, grape phylloxera, using a mitochondrial
SO Molecular ecology
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB Range expansions through human introductions have increased with global commerce  and have led to the extinction of native species, alterations in community  structure and pest status of the invasive species. Inferring the evolutionary  history of invasive species can help to build a firmer footing for management  tactics. This study used mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) sequence comparisons of  samples collected from the native and introduced ranges of a pest herbivore of  cultivated grapes, grape phylloxera (Daktulosphaira vitifoliae Fitch,  Phylloxeridae) to infer the sources and pattern of introductions into worldwide  viticulture. Introductions into viticulture from its native North American range  first occurred in the mid-19th century. The pattern of spread has suggested a  focus of introduction into France, but independent introductions may have  occurred elsewhere. The results show that the introduced population represents a  limited subsample of the native genetic diversity. The data suggest that most  grape phylloxera in viticulture, including all European, have originated in the  northeastern USA where the grape species Vitis riparia dominates. There was  evidence for independent introductions into South Africa and California. Most  California haplotypes were most closely related to native grape phylloxera from  the Atlantic Coast on V. vulpina. It is likely that subsequent spread from  California into Australia, New Zealand and Peru has occurred.

TI Accumulation of deleterious mutations: additional Drosophila melanogaster
SO Evolution; international journal of organic evolution
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB We report an assay of egg-to-adult viability in full-sibling mutation  accumulation (MA) lines derived from a completely homozygous population of  Drosophila melanogaster and maintained for 210 generations. A simultaneous  evaluation was also made of a large population derived from the same origin and  maintained as a control for the same period. We also present computer simulations  to explore the possible decline in viability of the control population due to  mutation accumulation and the possible effect of selection within and between MA  lines. For this purpose, we used two mutational models independent from the data  analyzed and based on radically different assumptions. The first model implies a  large number of mutations of small effect, whereas the second implies a much  smaller number of mutations with much larger effects. The observed rate of  decline in mean viability was very small but significant (0.077%). The rate of  increase in among line variance (0.189 x 10(-3)) was similar to those obtained  previously in the same lines. The simulation results indicated that a model of  many mutations of small effect is incompatible with the evolution of the mean  viability of the control and MA lines over generations, the distribution of line  means after 210 generations of mutation accumulation, and the pattern of line  extinction over generations. Basically, this model predicted a large drop in  viability, both in the control and particularly the MA lines, that is not  observed empirically. It also predicted a rate of line extinction too low in the  early generations and too high in the later ones. In contrast, the model based on  few mutations of large effect was generally consistent with all the observations.

TI On the evolution of cytoplasmic incompatibility in haplodiploid species.
SO Evolution; international journal of organic evolution
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB The most enigmatic sexual manipulation by Wolbachia endosymbionts is cytoplasmic  incompatibility (CI): infected males are reproductively incompatible with  uninfected females. In this paper, we extend the theory on population dynamics  and evolution of CI, with emphasis on haplodiploid species. First, we focus on  the problem of the threshold to invasion of the Wolbachia infection in a  population. Simulations of the dynamics of infection in small populations show  that it does not suffice to assume invasion by drift alone (or demographic  "accident"). We propose several promising alternatives that may facilitate  invasion of Wolbachia in uninfected populations: sex-ratio effects, meta  population structure, and other fitness-compensating effects. Including sex-ratio  effects of Wolbachia allows invasion whenever infected females produce more  infected daughters than uninfected females produce uninfected daughters. Several  studies on haplodiploid species suggest the presence of such sex-ratio effects.  The simple metapopulation model we analyzed predicts that, given that infecteds  are better "invaders," uninfecteds must be better "colonizers" to maintain  coexistence of infected and uninfected patches. This condition seems more  feasible for species that suffer local extinction due to predation (or  parasitization) than for species that suffer local extinction due to  overexploiting their resource(s). Finally, we analyze the evolution of CI in  haplodiploids once a population has been infected. Evolution does not depend on  the type of CI (female mortality or male production), but hinges solely on  decreasing the fitness cost and/or increasing the transmission efficiency. Our  models offer new perspectives for increasing our understanding of the population  and evolutionary dynamics of CI.

TI The Africanization of honeybees (Apis mellifera L.) of the Yucatan: a study of a
SO Evolution; international journal of organic evolution
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB Until recently, African and European subspecies of the honeybee (Apis mellifera  L.) had been geographically separated for around 10,000 years. However,  human-assisted introductions have caused the mixing of large populations of  African and European subspecies in South and Central America, permitting an  unprecedented opportunity to study a large-scale hybridization event using  molecular analyses. We obtained reference populations from Europe, Africa, and  South America and used these to provide baseline information for a microsatellite  and mitochondrial analysis of the process of Africanization of the bees of the  Yucatan Peninsula, Mexico. The genetic structure of the Yucatecan population has  changed dramatically over time. The pre-Africanized Yucatecan population (1985)  comprised bees that were most similar to samples from southeastern Europe and  northern and western Europe. Three years after the arrival of Africanized bees  (1989), substantial paternal gene flow had occurred from feral Africanized drones  into the resident European population, but maternal gene flow from the invading  Africanized population into the local population was negligible. However by 1998,  there was a radical shift with both African nuclear alleles (65%) and  African-derived mitochondria (61%) dominating the genomes of domestic colonies.  We suggest that although European mitochondria may eventually be driven to  extinction in the feral population, stable introgression of European nuclear  alleles has occurred.

TI Evolutionary shifts between host oak sections and host-plant organs in Andricus
SO Evolution; international journal of organic evolution
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB Gall-inducing insects have especially intimate interactions with their host  plants and generally show great specificity with regard to both the host-plant  species and the organ (e.g. flower, leaf) galled. However, the relative roles of  shifts between host species and between host-plant organs in the diversification  of gall-inducers are uncertain. We employ a novel and general maximum-likelihood  approach to show that shifts between host-plant organs occur at a significantly  greater rate than shifts between host oak sections in European Andricus  gallwasps. This suggests that speciation has more often been associated with gall  location shifts than with colonization of new host-plant species, and implies  that it may be easier for gall-inducers to colonize new plant organs than new  plant species. Andricus gallwasps have complex life cycles, with obligate  alternation of sexual and parthenogenetic generations. Our phylogenetic analyses  show that a life cycle with both generations galling white oaks (section Quercus)  is ancestral, with a single shift of the sexual generation onto black oaks  (section Cerris) to generate a clade with a novel host-alternating life cycle.  This new life cycle provided the opportunity for further speciation, but may have  also increased the risk of extinction of one or both generations by the  demographic requirement for co-existence of both host-plant groups. In summary,  it appears that Andricus gallwasp radiation may be a two-level process.  Speciation events often involve shifts in gall location on the same host species.  However, there are only so many ways to gall an oak, and rare shifts to new oak  sections may contribute greatly to long-term diversification by opening up whole  new adaptive zones.

TI Assessment of possible ecological risks and hazards of transgenic fish with
SO Transgenic research
LA English
DT Review
AB Transgenic technology is developing rapidly; however, consumers and  environmentalists remain wary of its safety for use in agriculture. Research is  needed to ensure the safe use of transgenic technology and thus increase consumer  confidence. This goal is best accomplished by using a thorough, unbiased  examination of risks associated with agricultural biotechnology. In this paper,  we review discussion on risk and extend our approach to predict risk. We also  distinguish between the risk and hazard of transgenic organisms in natural  environments. We define transgene risk as the probability a transgene will spread  into natural conspecific populations and define hazard as the probability of  species extinction, displacement, or ecosystem disruption given that the  transgene has spread. Our methods primarily address risk relative to two types of  hazards: extinction which has a high hazard, and invasion which has an unknown  level of hazard, similar to that of an introduced exotic species. Our method of  risk assessment is unique in that we concentrate on the six major fitness  components of an organism's life cycle to determine if transgenic individuals  differ in survival or reproductive capacity from wild type. Our approach then  combines estimates of the net fitness parameters into a mathematical model to  determine the fate of the transgene and the affected wild population. We also  review aspects of fish ecology and behavior that contribute to risk and examine  combinations of net fitness parameters which can lead to invasion and extinction  hazards. We describe three new ways that a transgene could result in an  extinction hazard: (1) when the transgene increases male mating success but  reduces daily adult viability, (2) when the transgene increases adult viability  but reduces male fertility, and (3) when the transgene increases both male mating  success and adult viability but reduces male fertility. The last scenario is  predicted to cause rapid extinction, thus it poses an extreme risk. Although we  limit our discussion to aquacultural applications, our methods can easily be  adapted to other sexually reproducing organisms with suitable adjustments of  terminology.

TI Recovery after mass extinction: evolutionary assembly in large-scale biosphere
SO Philosophical transactions of the Royal Society of London. Series B, Biological
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB Biotic recoveries following mass extinctions are characterized by a process in  which whole ecologies are reconstructed from low-diversity systems, often  characterized by opportunistic groups. The recovery process provides an  unexpected window to ecosystem dynamics. In many aspects, recovery is very  similar to ecological succession, but important differences are also apparently  linked to the innovative patterns of niche construction observed in the fossil  record. In this paper, we analyse the similarities and differences between  ecological succession and evolutionary recovery to provide a preliminary  ecological theory of recoveries. A simple evolutionary model with three trophic  levels is presented, and its properties (closely resembling those observed in the  fossil record) are compared with characteristic patterns of ecological response  to disturbances in continuous models of three-level ecosystems.

DT Review
AB Diseases and biological toxins have been used as weapons of war throughout  recorded history, from Biblical times through to the present day. Bioweapon uses  have historically been directed primarily, although not exclusively, against  human populations. Specialised technicians and state-of-the-art research  facilities are no longer necessary for the production or deployment of many known  bioweapon agents and commercially available technologies now permit the  large-scale production of bioweapon agents in small-scale facilities at  relatively low cost. Failures in the detection and containment of bioweapon and  emerging disease outbreaks among populations of wildlife and indigenous peoples  in developing countries could result in severe erosion of genetic diversity in  local and regional populations of both wild and domestic animals, the extinction  of endangered species and the extirpation of indigenous peoples and their  cultures. Our ability to understand and control the spread of diseases within and  among human and animal populations is increasing but is still insufficient to  counter the threats presented by existing bioweapon diseases and the growing  number of highly pathogenic emergent infections. Interdisciplinary and  international efforts to increase the monitoring, surveillance, identification  and reporting of disease agents and to better understand the potential dynamics  of disease transmission within human and animal populations in both  industrialised and developing country settings will greatly enhance our ability  to combat the effects of bioweapons and emerging diseases on biological  communities and biodiversity.

TI Resistance to extinction of low fitness virus subjected to plaque-to-plaque
SO Journal of molecular biology
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB Plaque-to-plaque transfers of RNA viruses lead to accumulation of mutations and  fitness decrease. To test whether continuing plaque-to-plaque transfers would  lead to viral extinction, we have subjected several low fitness foot-and-mouth  disease virus (FMDV) clones to up to 130 successive plaque transfers, and have  analyzed the evolution of plaque titers and genomic nucleotide sequences. No case  of viral extinction could be documented. Some low fitness clones that posses an  internal poly(A) tract evaded extinction by modifying the length or base  composition of the poly(A) tract. The comparison of entire genomic sequences of  FMDV clones at increasing plaque transfer number revealed that mutations  accumulated at a uniform rate, and that they were distributed unevenly along the  genome. Clusters of mutations were identified at different genomic sites in two  plaque transfer lineages. Mutation clustering appears to occur stochastically and  could not be related to fixation of compensatory mutations. The results document  resistance of viral clones to extinction, and suggest that mutation clustering  may be a mechanism of genetic diversification of low fitness virus.

TI Choosing appropriate temporal and spatial scales for ecological restoration.
SO Journal of biosciences
LA English
DT Review
AB Classic ecological restoration seems tacitly to have taken the Clementsian  "balance of nature" paradigm for granted: plant succession terminates in a climax  community which remains at equilibrium until exogenously disturbed after which  the process of succession is restarted until the climax is reached. Human  disturbance is regarded as unnatural and to have commenced in the Western  Hemisphere at the time of European incursion. Classic ecological restoration thus  has a clear and unambiguous target and may be conceived as aiming to foreshorten  the natural processes that would eventually lead to the climax of a given site,  which may be determined by its state at "settlement". According to the new "flux  of nature" paradigm in ecology a given site has no telos and is constantly  changing. Human disturbance is ubiquitous and long-standing, and at certain  spatial and temporal scales is "incorporated". Any moment in the past 10,000  years that may be selected as a benchmark for restoration efforts thus appears to  be arbitrary. Two prominent conservationists have therefore suggested that the  ecological conditions in North America at the Pleistocene-Holocene boundary,  prior to the anthropogenic extinction of the Pleistocene megafauna, be the target  for ecological restoration. That suggestion explicitly assumes evolutionary  temporal scales and continental spatial scales as the appropriate frame of  reference for ecological restoration. However, ecological restoration should be  framed in ecological spatio-temporal scales, which may be defined temporally in  reference to ecological processes such as disturbance regimes and spatially in  reference to ecological units such as landscapes, ecosystems, and biological  provinces. Ecological spatio-temporal scales are also useful in achieving a  scientifically defensible distinction between native and exotic species, which  plays so central a role in the practice of ecological restoration and the  conservation of biodiversity. Because post-settlement human disturbances have  exceeded the limits of such scales, settlement conditions can be justified  scientifically as appropriate targets of restoration efforts without recourse to  obsolete teleological concepts of equilibria and without ignoring the presence  and ecological influence of indigenous peoples.

TI Mass extinction in a dynamical system of evolution with variable dimension.
SO Physical review. E, Statistical physics, plasmas, fluids, and related
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB Introducing the effect of extinction into the so-called replicator equations in  mathematical biology, we construct a general model where the diversity of  species, i.e., the dimension of the equation, is a time-dependent variable. The  system shows very different behavior from the original replicator equation, and  leads to mass extinction when the system initially has high diversity. The  present theory can serve as a mathematical foundation for the paleontologic  theory for mass extinction. This extinction dynamics is a prototype of dynamical  systems where the variable dimension is inevitable.

TI Akodon sex reversed females: the never ending story.
SO Cytogenetic and genome research
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB The existence of fertile A. azarae females with a chromosome sex pair  indistinguishable from that of males was reported more than 35 years ago. These  heterogametic females were initially thought to occur due to an extreme process  of dosage compensation in which X inactivation was restricted to Xp and  complemented by a deletion of Xq (Xx females). Later on, a C-banding analysis of  A. mollis variant females showed that these specimens were in fact XY* sex  reversed and not Xx females. The finding of positive testing for Zfy and Sry  multiple-copy genes in Akodon males and heterogametic females confirmed the XY*  assumption. At the present time, XY* sex reversed females have been found to  exist in nine Akodon species. Akodon heterogametic females produce X and Y*  oocytes, which upon sperm fertilization give rise to viable XX (female), XY*  (female), and XY (male) embryos, and to non-viable Y*Y zygotes. Heterozygous  females exhibit a better reproductive performance than XX females in order to  compensate the Y*Y zygote wastage. XY* sex reversed females are assumed to occur  due to a deficient Sry expression resulting in the development of ovaries instead  of testes. Moreover, the appearance of Y* elements is a highly recurrent event.  It is proposed that homozygosity for an autosomal or pseudoautosomal recessive  mutation (s-) inhibits Sry expression giving rise to XY* embryos with ovary  development. Location of the Y* chromosome in the female germ cell lineage  produces an ovary-specific imprinting of the Sry* gene maintaining its defective  expression through generations independently from the presence or absence of s-  homozygosity. By escaping the ovary-specific methylation some Y* chromosomes turn  back to normal Ys producing Y oocytes capable of generating normal male embryos  when fertilized by an X sperm. Fluctuations in the rate of variant females in  field populations and in laboratory colonies of Akodon depend on the balance  between the appearance of new variant females (s-/s-, XY* specimens) and the  extinction of sex reversed specimens due to imprinting escape.

TI A ratio-dependent food chain model and its applications to biological control.
SO Mathematical biosciences
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB While biological controls have been successfully and frequently implemented by  nature and human, plausible mathematical models are yet to be found to explain  the often observed deterministic extinctions of both pest and control agent in  such processes. In this paper we study a three trophic level food chain model  with ratio-dependent Michaelis-Menten type functional responses. We shall show  that this model is rich in boundary dynamics and is capable of generating such  extinction dynamics. Two trophic level Michaelis-Menten type ratio-dependent  predator-prey system was globally and systematically analyzed in details  recently. A distinct and realistic feature of ratio-dependence is its capability  of producing the extinction of prey species, and hence the collapse of the  system. Another distinctive feature of this model is that its dynamical outcomes  may depend on initial populations levels. Theses features, if preserved in a  three trophic food chain model, make it appealing for modelling certain  biological control processes (where prey is a plant species, middle predator as a  pest, and top predator as a biological control agent) where the simultaneous  extinctions of pest and control agent is the hallmark of their successes and are  usually dependent on the amount of control agent. Our results indicate that this  extinction dynamics and sensitivity to initial population levels are not only  preserved, but also enriched in the three trophic level food chain model.  Specifically, we provide partial answers to questions such as: under what  scenarios a potential biological control may be successful, and when it may fail.  We also study the questions such as what conditions ensure the coexistence of all  the three species in the forms of a stable steady state and limit cycle,  respectively. A multiple attractor scenario is found.

TI Dynamics of extinction and the selection of nature reserves.
SO Proceedings. Biological sciences
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB Familiar quantitative reserve-selection techniques are tailored to simple  decision problems, where the representation of species is sought at minimum cost.  However, conservationists have begun to ask whether representing species in  reserve networks is sufficient to avoid local extinctions within selected areas.  An attractive, but previously untested idea is to model current species'  probabilities of occurrence as an estimate of local persistence in the near  future. Using distribution data for passerine birds in Great Britain, we show  that (i) species' probabilities of occurrence are negatively related to local  probabilities of extinction, at least when a particular 20-year period is  considered, and (ii) local extinctions can be reduced if areas are selected to  maximize current species' probabilities of occurrence We suggest that more  extinctions could be avoided if even a simple treatment of persistence were to be  incorporated within reserve selection methods.

TI Coevolution of costly mate choice and condition-dependent display of good genes.
SO Proceedings. Biological sciences
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB Females often choose their mates, instead of mating at random, even when a father  contributes nothing but genes to his offspring. Costly female preferences for  males with exaggerated traits that reduce viability, such as the peacock's tail,  are particularly puzzling. Such preferences can evolve if directly favoured by  natural selection or when the exaggerated trait, although maladaptive per se,  indicates high overall quality of the male's genotype. Two recent analyses  suggested that the advantage to mate choice based on genetic quality is too weak  to explain extreme cases of exaggeration of display traits and the corresponding  preferences. We studied coevolution of a female mate-preference function and a  genotype-dependent male display function where mutation supplies variation in  genotype quality and mate preference is costly. Preference readily evolves, often  causing extreme exaggeration of the display. Mate choice and trait expression can  approach an equilibrium, or a limit cycle, or exaggeration can proceed forever,  eventually causing extinction.

TI Deleterious alleles and differential viability in progeny of natural hemiclonal
SO Evolution; international journal of organic evolution
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB Abstract.-Spontaneous deleterious mutations are expected to accumulate through  Muller's ratchet in clonally reproducing organisms and may lead to their  extinction. We study deleterious mutations and their effects in a system of  European frogs. Rana esculenta (RL), natural hybrids R. ridibunda (RR) X R.  lessonae (LL), reproduce hemiclonally; both sexes exclude the L genome in the  germ line and produce unrecombined R gametes; hybridity is restored each  generation by matings of RL with coexisting LL. Different allozyme-defined hybrid  hemiclones (R genome haplotypes) are thought to have originated independently  from primary hybridizations RR x LL. Natural matings between two hybrids usually  lead to inviable RR tadpoles. This inviability is thought to result from unmasked  deleterious alleles on the clonally transmitted R genomes. Most simply it  reflects homozygosity for recessive deleterious alleles at particular loci;  alternatively (consistent with absence of RR adults in multiclonal populations)  it may reflect hemiclone-specific sets of incompletely recessive deleterious  mutations that cumulatively cause inviability when two such genomes are combined.  If inviability results from the former, progeny of two hybrids of different  hemiclones, whether allopatric or coexisting, should be viable, because it is  improbable that their R genomes share recessive deleterious alleles at the same  set of loci; if inviability results from the latter, progeny of hybrids of  different hemiclones should be inviable, especially when hybrid lineages are old.  We tested these hypotheses in artificial crosses, using frogs from three regions:  hemiclonal hybrids outside R. ridibunda's range from northern Switzerland (two  abundant coexisting allozyme-defined hemiclones; estimated lineage age < or =  5,000 generations) and from Sicily, Italy (one hemiclone; estimated age > or =  25,000 generations) and R. ridibunda from Poland. We generated RR progeny, which  we reared under benign conditions in the laboratory, by crossing (1) two hybrids  from the same region (H x H local); (2) two hybrids from different regions (H X H  foreign); (3) hybrids and R. ridibunda (H X R); and (4) two R. ridibunda (R X R).  Survival to metamorphosis was similar and high for R x R, H X H foreign, and H X  R, whereas all tadpoles of H X H local died before metamorphosis. This supports  the hypothesis that homozygosity for recessive deleterious mutations at  particular loci causes inviability. Crosses within and between the two coexisting  hemiclones from Switzerland were, however, equally inviable. This result may  reflect episodic sexual recombination in RR progeny from exceptional successful  interclonal hybrid X hybrid matings, followed by matings of such RR with LL. This  process would both slow down or halt Muller's ratchet and disrupt genetic  independence of coexisting hemiclones, so that the same remaining deleterious R  alleles could exist in different allozyme-defined hemiclones. Whereas all data  are consistent with the prediction of Muller's ratchet operating on clonally  transmitted R genomes of natural hybrid lineages, they are insufficient to  demonstrate such operation, because deleterious recessives that mutated after  clone formation and those that preexisted in the R. ridibunda source populations  that formed the hemiclonal lineages are not distinguished. The possibility of  episodic sexual recombination must be carefully taken into account when studying  Muller's ratchet in natural populations of this Rana system.

SO Vision research
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB On the basis of recent neurophysiological results related to research in the  noradrenergic system we predicted a correlation between platelet MAO activity,  serum DBH and the strength of the contrast illusion (Uznadze effect) provoked in  the visual field. The mechanism of this illusion is that the neuronal  representation of a previously inspected figure distorts the correct perception  of a subsequently displayed test figure. Those layers that play important role in  these processes are under massive noradrenergic influence. This gives sufficient  reason to test our hypothesis. Thirty healthy subjects were submitted to blood  sampling and psychological experiment. A significant negative correlation was  found between MAO activity and the strength of the contrast illusion (R:-0.3634;  p<0.05). This result is relevant to the hypothesis that platelet MAO activity  could be a good marker of the activity of the monoaminergic systems in the brain.  At the same time the correlation that was found suggests that the fixed set  method could be a useful noninvasive tool for biological personality research on  this field.

DT Journal Article
AB To represent species turnover in tropical rain forest, we use a neutral model  where a tree's fate is not affected by what species it belongs to, seeds disperse  a limited distance from their parents, and speciation is in equilibrium with  random extinction. We calculate the similarity function, the probability F(r)  that two trees separated by a distance r belong to the same species, assuming  that the dispersal kernel P(r), the distribution of seeds about their parents and  the prospects of mortality and reproduction, are the same for all trees  regardless of their species. If P(r) is radially symmetric Gaussian with  mean-square dispersal distance sigma, F(r) can be expressed in closed form. If  P(r) is a radially symmetric Cauchy distribution, then, in two-dimensional space,  F(r) is proportional to 1/r for large r. Analytical results are compared with  individual-based simulations, and the relevance to field observations is  discussed.

SO Physical review. E, Statistical physics, plasmas, fluids, and related
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB I study a lattice stochastic model of a mutating population sensitive to the  influence of a fluctuating environment. The dynamics of the population stressed  by linear and periodic disturbances is investigated. In agreement with previous  studies of nonspatial models, I find a critical rate of change in the  environmental variable beyond which the population becomes extinct, and I show  explicitly that the presence of space in the model can affect the critical rate.  Further, I study the diversity defined as the total number of different cell  types present in the lattice as a function of intensity and frequency of the  environmental disturbance. If the disturbance becomes fast and intense the  population becomes extinct. Interestingly, I find that for moderate stresses the  diversity increases with the intensity and frequency of disturbance. The  transition between large diversity and extinction is sharp, implying that the  populations with high diversity are generally the ones closest to the extinction  threshold. When subjected to colored noise of increasing intensity the system  grows in diversity but at the same time is more likely to become extinct.

SO Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America

DT Journal Article
AB Comparative phylogeography has proved useful for investigating biological  responses to past climate change and is strongest when combined with extrinsic  hypotheses derived from the fossil record or geology. However, the rarity of  species with sufficient, spatially explicit fossil evidence restricts the  application of this method. Here, we develop an alternative approach in which  spatial models of predicted species distributions under serial paleoclimates are  compared with a molecular phylogeography, in this case for a snail endemic to the  rainforests of North Queensland, Australia. We also compare the phylogeography of  the snail to those from several endemic vertebrates and use consilience across  all of these approaches to enhance biogeographical inference for this rainforest  fauna. The snail mtDNA phylogeography is consistent with predictions from  paleoclimate modeling in relation to the location and size of climatic refugia  through the late Pleistocene-Holocene and broad patterns of extinction and  recolonization. There is general agreement between quantitative estimates of  population expansion from sequence data (using likelihood and coalescent methods)  vs. distributional modeling. The snail phylogeography represents a composite of  both common and idiosyncratic patterns seen among vertebrates, reflecting the  geographically finer scale of persistence and subdivision in the snail. In  general, this multifaceted approach, combining spatially explicit  paleoclimatological models and comparative phylogeography, provides a powerful  approach to locating historical refugia and understanding species' responses to  them.

TI Bet-hedging applications for conservation.
SO Journal of biosciences
LA English
DT Review
AB One of the early tenets of conservation biology is that population viability is  enhanced by maintaining multiple populations of a species. The strength of this  tenet is justified by principles of bet-hedging. Management strategies that  reduce variance in population size will also reduce risk of extinction.  Asynchrony in population fluctuations in independent populations reduces variance  in the aggregate of populations whereas environmental correlation among areas  increases the risk that all populations will go extinct. We review the  theoretical rationale of bet-hedging and suggest applications for conservation  management of least terns in Nebraska and grizzly bears in the northern Rocky  Mountains of the United States. The risk of extinction for least terns will be  reduced if we can sustain the small central Platte River population in addition  to the larger population on the lower Platte. Similarly, by restoring grizzly  bears to the Bitterroot wilderness of Idaho and Montana can reduce the  probability of extinction for grizzly bears in the Rocky Mountains of the United  States by as much as 69-93%.

AB Modeling of fossil diversity dynamics is usually done with the help of the models  borrowed from the population dynamics theory. However there are principal  differences between organisms and taxa, reproduction and divergence, mortality  and extinction that make this approach doubtful. Another model is presented here,  in which absolute origination rate does not depend on diversity, the ability of  new genera to sustain unpredictable environmental changes increases three times  abruptly at Cambrian/Ordovician, Permian/Triassic and Cretaceous/Tertiary  boundaries. In this model the diversity increases due to accumulation of  long-lived genera. The computer simulation showed that the model agrees with  empirical data by 15 major criteria. The laws of community evolution apparently  can explain the general pattern of punctuated equilibrium in the evolution of  marine biota.

Nine percent of the native flora of 1159  taxa are already extinct, and 52.5% are at risk (extinct, endangered, vulnerable,  or rare). Risk is strongly associated with limited geographic distribution at  several scales: endemic taxa (native only to the Hawaiian Islands) are at far  greater risk than indigenous taxa (with both Hawaiian and extra-Hawaiian ranges);  single-island endemics are more at risk than multi-island endemics; small islands  have the highest proportion of endemic taxa at risk; and endemics with more  limited habitat distributions (elevation, community type) are more at risk.  Historic population density is a strong predictor of risk, and taxa with low  historic population densities are at greatest risk with rapid anthropogenic  changes. Among the major islands, Maui Nui has the highest percent of taxa that  are extinct. Kaua'i has the lowest percent of extinct taxa and the highest  proportion of single-island endemic taxa that are rare. Endemic taxa at risk are  associated with distributions in shrublands, forests, bogs, and cliff habitats.  Endemic taxa with distributions in low elevation dry habitats have the highest  proportion of taxa at risk, but the greatest absolute numbers of taxa at risk  have distributions in mesic lowland and montane forests, and in wet montane  forests. The life history patterns associated with risk are complicated, and  inclusion of the effects of evolutionary relationships (lineages) changes some of  these patterns. Species level analyses without respect to lineage shows risk  associated with monomorphic (hermaphroditic) breeding systems and bird  pollination because of the large number of hermaphroditic, bird-pollinated  species in the Campanulaceae. Analyses incorporating the effect of lineage  greatly reduce the impact of large lineages and result in an association of risk  with insect pollination, and no effect of breeding system. There is no  association of lineage size and the percent of taxa at risk within the lineage;  endemic taxa from lineages with large radiations are at no greater risk than  endemic single-taxon lineages. The percentages of taxa at risk at the family  level in the Hawaiian Islands and worldwide (excluding Hawaiian taxa) are  positively correlated, although flowering plant families in the Hawaiian Islands  have a much greater proportion of taxa at risk. Some of the approaches described  here may be useful to predict geographical and biological patterns of  endangerment in island and island-like ecosystems under increasing pressures of  endangerment and extinction.

DT Journal Article
AB Computer programs have been written to study the dynamic interaction in humans  between environmental mutagenesis, the genomic load of deleterious mutations and  the probability of zygote survival. The human genome is complex and highly  redundant and as a consequence deleterious mutations accumulate. The computer  programs are based on a model of the human genome in which deleterious mutations  interact synergistically causing impaired performance in individual systems and  this leads to a positive correlation between the total number of deleterious  mutations in the genome and impaired performance across the whole spectrum of  biological capability. This includes performance in intellectual tasks, sporting  ability, the ability to fight disease and preserve health and the development of  a symmetrical physical form. Sexual reproduction distributes deleterious  mutations unequally amongst zygotes and the model predicts that zygote survival  will correlate negatively with zygote mutational load. The computer simulation  shows that rising environmental mutagenesis will lead to a rise in the human  genomic mutational load and to decreased zygote survival, although the full  effect would take several generations. If this occurred the health of future  generations would suffer and methods to monitor environmental mutagenesis are  required. The model also shows that a marked rise in environmental mutagenesis  would lead to species extinction if mate choice were random, i.e., unrelated to  the genomic mutational load. The biological imperfections caused by mutations,  however, in health, intelligence and physical symmetry are all, to varying  degrees, related to sexual attraction. The model shows that if mates are chosen  in response to sexual attraction the species can be maintained in the presence of  high environmental mutagenesis. A polygamous pattern in which females mate with a  minority of males has the most marked effect in reducing the number of  deleterious mutations in the next generation. The model also shows that as  environmental mutagenesis falls the number of eligible males would increase and a  species would change from a polygamous to a monogamous pattern of mating. These  results imply that we are not attracted by good genes, but by a lack of bad  genes. Sexual attraction is a force which counteracts genomic degradation.

TI Survival without recovery after mass extinctions.
SO Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB Because many survivors of mass extinctions do not participate in postrecovery  diversifications, and therefore fall into a pattern that can be termed "Dead  Clade Walking" (DCW), the effects of mass extinctions extend beyond the losses  observed during the event itself. Analyses at two taxonomic levels provide a  first-order test of the prevalence of DCWs by using simple and very conservative  operational criteria. For four of the Big Five mass extinctions of the  Phanerozoic, the marine genera that survived the extinction suffered  approximately 10-20% attrition in the immediately following geologic stage that  was significantly greater than the losses sustained in preextinction stages. The  stages immediately following the three Paleozoic mass extinctions also account  for 17% of all order-level losses in marine invertebrates over that interval,  which is, again, significantly greater than that seen for the other stratigraphic  stages (no orders are lost immediately after the end-Triassic or end-Cretaceous  mass extinctions). DCWs are not evenly distributed among four regional molluscan  time-series following the end-Cretaceous extinction, demonstrating the importance  of spatial patterns in recovery dynamics. Although biotic interactions have been  invoked to explain the differential postextinction success of clades, such  hypotheses must be tested against alternatives that include stochastic processes  in low-diversity lineages-which is evidently not a general explanation for the  ordinal DCW patterns, because postextinction fates are not related to the size of  extinction bottlenecks in Paleozoic orders-and ongoing physical environmental  changes.

TI Evolutionary speed limits inferred from the fossil record.
SO Nature
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB The dynamics of extinction and diversification determine the long-term effects of  extinction episodes. If rapid bursts of extinction are offset by equally rapid  bursts of diversification, their biodiversity consequences will be transient. But  if diversification rates cannot accelerate rapidly enough, pulses of extinction  will lead to long-lasting depletion of biodiversity. Here I use spectral analysis  of the fossil record to test whether diversification rates can accelerate as much  as extinction rates, over both short and long spans of geological time. I show  that although the long-wavelength variability of diversification rates equals or  exceeds that of extinctions, diversification rates are markedly less variable  than extinction rates at wavelengths shorter than roughly 25 million years. This  implies that there are intrinsic speed limits that constrain how rapidly  diversification rates can accelerate in response to pulses of extinction.

TI Spatio-temporal dynamics of species richness in coastal fish communities.
SO Proceedings. Biological sciences
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB Determining patterns of change in species richness and the processes underlying  the dynamics of biodiversity are of key interest within the field of ecology, but  few studies have investigated the dynamics of vertebrate communities at a decadal  temporal scale. Here, we report findings on the spatio-temporal variability in  the richness and composition of fish communities along the Norwegian Skagerrak  coast having been surveyed for more than half a century. Using statistical models  incorporating non-detection and associated sampling variance, we estimate local  species richness and changes in species composition allowing us to compute  temporal variability in species richness. We tested whether temporal variation  could be related to distance to the open sea and to local levels of pollution.  Clear differences in mean species richness and temporal variability are observed  between fjords that were and were not exposed to the effects of pollution.  Altogether this indicates that the fjord is an appropriate scale for studying  changes in coastal fish communities in space and time. The year-to-year rates of  local extinction and turnover were found to be smaller than spatial differences  in community composition. At the regional level, exposure to the open sea plays a  homogenizing role, possibly due to coastal currents and advection.

TI Disease in endangered metapopulations: the importance of alternative hosts.
SO Proceedings. Biological sciences
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB Conventional applications of metapopulation theory have suggested that increasing  migration between patches is usually good for conservation. A recent analysis by  Hess has pointed out a possible exception to this: when infectious disease is  present, migration may promote disease spread and therefore increase local  extinction. We extend Hess's model to discuss this problem: when infections have  spilled over from more abundant alternative hosts. This is often the case for  species of conservation concern, and we find that Hess's conclusions must be  substantially modified. We use deterministic analytic and stochastic numerical  approaches to show that movement between patches will rarely have a negative  impact, even when the probability of external infection is low.

TI Fidelity and spatio-temporal control in MAP kinase (ERKs) signalling.
SO Biochemical pharmacology
LA English
DT Review
AB Extracellular signals transduced via receptor tyrosine kinases, G-protein-coupled  receptors or integrins activate Ras, a key switch in cellular signalling.  Although Ras can activate multiple downstream effectors (PI3K, Ral em leader )  one of the major activated pathway is a conserved sequential protein kinase  cascade referred to as the mitogen activated protein (MAP) kinase module:  Raf>MEK>ERK. The fidelity of signalling among protein kinases and the  spatio-temporal activation are certainly key determinants for generating precise  biological responses. The fidelity is ensured by scaffold proteins, a sort of  protein kinase "insulators" and/or specific docking sites among the members of  the signalling cascade. These docking sites are found in upstream and downstream  regulators and MAPK substrates [Nat Cell Biol 2 2000 110]. The duration and the  intensity of the response are in part controlled by the compartmentalisation of  the signalling molecules. Growth factors promote nuclear accumulation and  persistent activation of ERK (p42/p44 MAP kinases) during the entire G1 period  with an extinction during S-phase. These features are exquisitely well controlled  by (i) the temporal induction of the MAP kinase phosphatases, MKP1-3, and (ii)  the compartmentalisation of the signalling molecules. We have shown that MKP1-2  induction is strictly controlled by the activation of the MAP kinase module  providing evidence for an autoregulatory mechanism. This negative regulatory loop  was further enhanced by the capacity of ERK to phosphorylate MKP1 and 2. This  action reduced the degradation rate of these MKPs through the  ubiquitin-proteasomal system [Science 286 1999 2514]. Whereas the two upstream  kinases of the module, Raf and MEK remained cytoplasmic, ERK anchored to MEK in  the cytoplasm of resting cells, rapidly translocated to the nucleus upon  mitogenic stimulation. This process was rapid, reversible, and controlled by the  strict activation of the MAPK cascade. Prevention of this nuclear translocation,  by overexpression of a cytoplasmic ERK-docking molecule (inactive MKP3) prevented  growth factor-stimulated DNA replication [EMBO J 18 1999 664]. Following long  term stimulation, ERK progressively accumulated in the nucleus in an inactive  form. This nuclear retention relied on the neosynthesis of short-lived nuclear  anchoring proteins. Nuclear inactivation and sequestration was likely to be  controlled by MAP kinase phosphatases 1 and 2. Therefore we propose that the  nucleus represents a site for ERK action, sequestration and signal termination [J  Cell Sci 114 2001 3433]. In addition, with the generation of mice invalidated for  each of the ERK isoforms, we will illustrate that besides controlling cell  proliferation the ERK cascade also controls cell differentiation and cell  behaviour [Science 286 1999 1374].

TI Psychobiology of the acute stress response and its relationship to the
SO The Psychiatric clinics of North America

DT Review
AB The literature to date that examines the biology of the acute stress reactions  suggests that relatively lower baseline cortisol is associated with the  development of PTSD. This is particularly informative because of the ongoing  controversy surrounding baseline cortisol in PTSD. Studies have found low  baseline cortisol, normal range, and elevated baseline cortisol in chronic PTSD,  and it has been unclear whether this reflects methodologic differences across  studies or true heterogeneity within the disorder. Thus, the few studies to date  support the finding of low-normal baseline cortisol in chronic PTSD and suggest  that it is a pre-existing functional trait. Whether it plays an etiologic role or  is an epiphenomenon of some other process is unclear. What does seem clear,  however, is that this characteristic is relatively nonspecific to PTSD, given the  fact that low cortisol has been observed in multiple subject populations,  including normal individuals under chronic stress as well as chronic medical  conditions (for review see [23]). For example, it is possible that reduced  baseline cortisol reflects the net result of input to the hypothalamus from  cortical and subcortical regions of the brain linked to increased vigilance,  sensitization to trauma because of prior traumatic experiences, or genetic  factors. For example, primate studies have demonstrated persistent alterations in  HPA axis functioning in animals reared by mothers living in moderately stressful  conditions [24]. The development of PTSD is associated with sensitization of the  startle response. Because the neurobiology of startle is well characterized, this  finding implicates a role for specific neurocircuitry in PTSD [25].  Non-habituation of the startle response in PTSD appears related to sensitization  specifically to contextual cues (i.e., the environment) that signal the presence  of potential threat of danger-related fears [26]. This may be the neurobiological  correlate to the over-generalization seen in PTSD that distinguishes the disorder  from a simple trauma-induced phobia. The bed nucleus of the stria terminalis  (BNST) is specifically implicated from preclinical research in the mediation of  context-dependent cues [1]. Treatments that result in down-regulation of the BNST  are therefore of particular interest in therapeutic models of prevention after  trauma. The fact that a number of vulnerability factors associated with increased  risk for developing PTSD are also likely to be biologically based (e.g., a  genetic component, prior psychiatric history, prior family of history of  psychiatric disorder), provides further evidence in support of a role for  psychobiological factors in producing PTSD. Nevertheless, the considerable  overlap on these measures between those who will develop PTSD, and those who  eventually recover spontaneously, belies any attempt to identify any single or  pathognomonic biological marker for risk. For now, the standard of care in  predicting level of symptomatology and prognosis in the acute setting continues  to be based on careful, informed, serial assessments of symptoms and functioning.  Because the capacity to learn from and adapt to adverse conditions are essential  to the survival of any species, understanding the neurobiological pathways that  mediate learning from traumatic experiences in an adaptive way is as important as  understanding the etiology of PTSD and other trauma-related maladaptive  consequences. Biological models that trace the causal cascade of post-traumatic  events in the brain and neuroendocrine systems may offer a multiplicity of  possibilities for intervention. It is well established that conditioned responses  are robust and persistent. Moreover, the primary mechanism of habituation is  overlearning rather than extinction. Interventions that promote overlearning may  therefore prove to be the most powerful and efficient preventative treatments.  The therapeutics literature supports this hypothesis, in that brief psychosocial  interventions based on sophisticated cognitive-behavioral models have proven  effective in reducing suffering, symptom severity, and chronicity in individuals  presenting with acute PTSD symptoms [27-29]. No acutely administered  pharmacologic treatment to date has been shown effective in accelerating the  process of recovery or in preventing the development of chronic PTSD. However,  pharmacologic interventions that would prevent sensitization of circuits related  to context-dependent threat perception, dysregulation of affect, and/or  dysregulation of normal circadian rhythms are of theoretical interest and deserve  further study.

TI Occupancy frequency distributions: patterns, artefacts and mechanisms.
SO Biological reviews of the Cambridge Philosophical Society
LA English
DT Review
AB Numerous hypotheses have been proposed to explain the shape of occupancy  frequency distributions (distributions of the numbers of species occupying  different numbers of areas). Artefactual effects include sampling  characteristics, whereas biological mechanisms include organismal, niche-based  and meta-population models. To date, there has been little testing of these  models. In addition, although empirically derived occupancy distributions  encompass an array of taxa and spatial scales, comparisons between them are often  not possible because of differences in sampling protocol and method of  construction. In this paper, the effects of sampling protocol (grain, sample  number, extent, sampling coverage and intensity) on the shape of occupancy  distributions are examined, and approaches for minimising artefactual effects  recommended. Evidence for proposed biological determinants of the shape of  occupancy distributions is then examined. Good support exists for some mechanisms  (habitat and environmental heterogeneity), little for others (dispersal ability),  while some hypotheses remain untested (landscape productivity, position in  geographic range, range size frequency distributions), or are unlikely to be  useful explanations for the shape of occupancy distributions 'species specificity  and adaptation to habitat, extinction-colonization dynamics). The presence of a  core (class containing species with the highest occupancy) mode in occupancy  distributions is most likely to be associated with larger sample units, and small  homogenous sampling areas positioned well within and towards the range centers of  a sufficient proportion of the species in the assemblage. Satellite (class with  species with the lowest occupancy) modes are associated with sampling large,  heterogeneous areas that incorporate a large proportion of the assemblage range.  However, satellite modes commonly also occur in the presence of a core mode, and  rare species effects are likely to contribute to the presence of a satellite mode  at most sampling scales. In most proposed hypotheses, spatial scale is an  important determinant of the shape of the observed occupancy distribution.  Because the attributes of the mechanisms associated with these hypotheses change  with spatial scale, their predictions for the shape of occupancy distributions  also change. To understand occupancy distributions and the mechanisms underlying  them, a synthesis of pattern documentation and model testing across scales is  thus needed. The development of null models, comparisons of occupancy  distributions across spatial scales and taxa, documentation of the movement of  individual species between occupancy classes with changes in spatial scale, as  well as further testing of biological mechanisms are all necessary for an  improved understanding of the distribution of species and assemblages within  their geographic ranges.

TI Speeding up reaction time with invisible stimuli.
SO Current biology : CB
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB Normal subjects react more quickly to a pair of visual stimuli than to a stimulus  alone. This phenomenon is known as the redundant signal effect (RSE) and  represents an example of divided visual attention in which signal processing is  carried out in parallel to the advantage of response speed. A most interesting  aspect of this phenomenon is that it can occur when one stimulus in a pair cannot  be consciously detected because of hemianopia or unilateral extinction resulting  from brain damage. Here, we report that a similar dissociation between visual  awareness and visually guided behavior is present in normal subjects who show an  RSE even when the luminance of one of a pair of stimuli is below detection  threshold. The observed RSE cannot be attributed to probability summation because  it violates Miller's race inequality and is likely to be related to neural  summation between supra- and subthreshold stimuli. Given that a similar implicit  RSE is present in hemispherectomy patients, we hypothesize that the site of this  summation might be the superior colliculus (SC).

TI Prehistoric bird extinctions and human hunting.
SO Proceedings. Biological sciences
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB Holocene fossils document the extinction of hundreds of bird species on Pacific  islands during prehistoric human occupation. Human hunting is implicated in these  extinctions, but the impact of hunting is difficult to disentangle from the  effects of other changes induced by humans, including habitat destruction and the  introduction of other mammalian predators. Here, we use data from bones collected  at a natural sand dune site and associated archaeological middens in New Zealand  to show that, having controlled for differences in body mass and family  membership (and hence for variation in life-history traits related to population  growth rate), birds that were more intensively hunted by prehistoric humans had a  higher probability of extinction. This result cannot be attributed to  preservation biases and provides clear evidence that selective hunting  contributed significantly to prehistoric bird extinctions at this site.

TI Shifts in hexapod diversification and what Haldane could have said.
SO Proceedings. Biological sciences
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB Data on species richness and taxon age are assembled for the extant hexapod  orders (insects and their six-legged relatives). Coupled with estimates of  phylogenetic relatedness, and simple statistical null models, these data are used  to locate where, on the hexapod tree, significant changes in the rate of  cladogenesis (speciation-minus-extinction rate) have occurred. Significant  differences are found between many successive pairs of sister taxa near the base  of the hexapod tree, all of which are attributable to a shift in diversification  rate after the origin of the Neoptera (insects with wing flexion) and before the  origin of the Holometabola (insects with complete metamorphosis). No other shifts  are identifiable amongst supraordinal taxa. Whilst the Coleoptera have probably  diversified faster than either of their putative sister lineages, they do not  stand out relative to other closely related clades. These results suggest that  any Creator had a fondness for a much more inclusive clade than the Coleoptera,  definitely as large as the Eumetabola (Holometabola plus bugs and their  relatives), and possibly as large as the entire Neoptera. Simultaneous, hence  probable causative events are discussed, of which the origin of wing flexion has  been the focus of much attention.

TI A markov chain approach to calculate r(0) in stochastic epidemic models.
SO Journal of theoretical biology
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB R(0) has been defined as "The expected number of secondary infections originated  by a "typical" infective individual when introduced into a population of  susceptibles", and it is perhaps the single most important parameter in epidemic  models. A general framework to calculate R(0) that can be applied to complicated  stochastic epidemic models that may include demography, several strains, latent  or carrier-like states, with or without density-dependent parameters is  introduced. This framework helps us to understand the concept of a "typical"  infective individual used in the deterministic definition of R(0). The method is  illustrated with applications to several epidemic models, including some in which  it has been found that the disease may persist even if R(0)<1. It is shown that  although the probability of extinction is difficult to calculate in these latter  cases, it is possible to give general conditions on the parameters under which  eventual extinction is certain.

TI Lateral plate evolution in the threespine stickleback: getting nowhere fast.
SO Genetica
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB Gasterosteus aculeatus is a small Holarctic fish with marine, anadromous, and  freshwater populations. Marine and anadromous populations apparently have changed  little in the past 10 million years and exhibit limited geographical variation.  In contrast, freshwater isolates have been founded repeatedly by marine and  anadromous populations, and post-glacial isolates have undergone extraordinary  adaptive radiation. Stickleback traits that have diversified during post-glacial  radiation, including the 'lateral plates' (LP), can evolve substantially within  decades after colonization of fresh water or when the environment (particularly  predation regime) changes. Although highly divergent freshwater isolates of G.  aculeatus have existed for at least 10 million years, they have rarely  experienced sustained evolutionary divergence leading to formation of widespread,  phenotypically distinct species. The paradox of rapid LP evolution without  sustained divergence has resulted from selective extinction of highly divergent  populations, because they are specialized for conditions in small, isolated  habitats that tend to dry up within limited periods. Biological species of G.  aculeatus may also evolve within decades, and are also prone to extinction  because they are endemic to and specialized for small, ephemeral habitats. The  high rate of evolution observed in contemporary threespine stickleback  populations may not be unique to this species complex and has important  implications for use of post-glacial populations in comparative studies,  speciation rate, and discrimination of sympatric and allopatric speciation.

TI Water-soluble aerosol and visibility degradation in Hong Kong during autumn and
SO Environmental pollution (Barking, Essex : 1987)
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB During the October-December 1998 period, 30 daily samples of size-separated  airborne respirable suspended particulates (RSP) were collected at the  quasi-rural Kadoorie Agricultural Research Centre (KARC) in central New  Territories (NT), Hong Kong, Special Administrative Region (SAR). Results of  analysis indicate that sulphate is the predominant water-soluble species, and  that sulphate, nitrate and ammonium together contribute to most of the total  water-soluble fine aerosol mass. An interesting result obtained through principal  component analysis (PCA) following varimax rotation of the bivariate correlation  matrix for water-soluble species is that the first component (PCl) is made up  exclusively of SO4 and NH4 ions. The stoichiometric ratio and correlation  coefficient between the two ions suggest that ammoniated sulphate compounds are  the probable species responsible for the PCI. Further, the use of a linear  multivariate visibility model which accommodates the effect of relative humidity  (RH) shows that SO4 and NH4 are the only anions important in visibility  degradation. It is found that SO4 in aerosol at the KARC can be used to predict  the visual range (or extinction coefficient) recorded from Kings Park, Kowloon,  approximately 10 km away. This result suggests that SO4 (and possibly NH4) is,  generally, likely to be of regional rather than of local origin. Further  observations suggest that the model is most applicable to a moderate visual  range, 10 km < R(v) < or = 20 km under a rather broad range of ambient relative  humidity, 40% < RH < or = 80. However, this inference does not preclude the  contributions to visibility degradation--mostly by absorption--by some of the  water-insoluble aerosol constituents, including carbon, or the pollutant gas,  NO2.

TI Increased competition may promote species coexistence.
SO Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB It is a mainstay of community ecology that local exclusion of species will result  if competitive pressures become too large. The pattern of exclusion may be  complicated, but the qualitative orthodoxy has changed little since the  pioneering work of Lotka, Volterra, and Gause--no two species can occupy the same  niche. Stated in a more precise form, the higher the intensity of interspecific  competition in an assemblage of species, the fewer the number of species that can  coexist in perpetuity. We suggest that this orthodoxy results from "linear"  thinking, and that if the classical equations are formulated more realistically  with attendant nonlinearities, the orthodoxy breaks down and higher levels of  competition may actually increase the likelihood that species will avoid  competitive exclusion. Furthermore, this increased probability of coexistence at  higher levels of competition is accompanied by characteristic dynamic patterns:  (i) at lower levels of competition, after all extinction events have occurred,  remaining species follow irregular chaotic patterns; (ii) at higher levels of  competition, when most species coexist, all species are entrained in a single  large limit cycle; (iii) the transient behavior appears to correspond to a  special case of chaos, uniform phase chaotic amplitude.

TI The universal properties of stem cells as pinpointed by a simple discrete model.
SO Journal of mathematical biology
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB The ability of a few stem-cells to repopulate a severely damaged bone marrow (BM)  guarantees the stability of our physical existence, and facilitates successful BM  transplantations. What are the basic properties of stem cells that enable the  maintenance of the system's homeostasis? In the present work we attempt to answer  this question by investigating a discrete (in time and phase-space) dynamical  system. The model we present is shown to retrieve the essential properties of  homeostasis, as reflected in BM functioning, namely, (a) to produce a constant  amount of mature cells, and (b) to be capable of returning to this production  after very large perturbations. The mechanism guaranteeing the fulfillment of  these properties is extrinsic--negative feedback control in the  micro-environment--and does not need additional stochastic assumptions.  Nevertheless, the existence of a simple intrinsic control mechanism, a clock  which determines the switch to differentiation, ascertains that the system does  not admit non-trivial extinction states. This result may help clarifying some of  the controversy about extrinsic versus intrinsic control over stem cell fate. It  should be stressed that all conclusions are valid for any system containing  progenitor and maturing cells.

TI A novel ultraviolet assay for testing side reactions of carbodiimides.
SO Analytical biochemistry
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB Carbodiimides possess considerable absorbance in the ultraviolet region; the  extinction coefficient of 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide (EDC) in  water is epsilon(214) = 6.3. 10(3) L x mol(-1) x cm(-1). It provides a very  simple method for testing possible side reactions of carbodiimides. This  technique was used to study effects of pH, different buffers, and other  components typically present in biological samples on EDC stability. It was shown  that the hydrolysis rate in pure water increased from 1.5. 10(-5) to 5. 10(-4)  s(-1) by pH decreasing from 7 to 4. A strong increase of the rate of EDC loss was  observed in the presence of different components. This effect can be described by  the following row of hydrolysis rates: citrate >> acetate approximately phosphate  >> SDS. The results can be used to optimize carbodiimide-mediated reactions of  peptide bond formation in organic chemistry or peptide synthesis or during  immobilization or cross-linking of biological molecules.

TI Treatment of sleep problems in families with small children: is written
SO Acta paediatrica (Oslo, Norway : 1992)
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB The aim of this study was to evaluate a standardized sleep programme, i.e. a  two-step variation of graduated extinction, where the child is first taught to  fall asleep by him/herself at bedtime (first intervention) and 2 wk later also  after night wakings (second intervention). The outcome after consultations with a  therapist followed by telephone support during both interventions was compared  with the outcome after giving written information only during the first  intervention and therapist support during the second. A total of 67 families with  infants exhibiting spontaneous awakening and crying episodes during the night  were randomly assigned to either programme. There were no significant differences  in terms of outcome between the two groups. In both groups the number of  registered night wakings decreased immediately following the first intervention.  At registration, at 1 mo and 3 mo later, all parents, with the exception of one  couple at the 3-mo follow-up, reported that the sleep problem had improved.  CONCLUSION: If parents experience their infant's night awakenings as a problem,  teaching their infant to fall asleep by him/herself usually solves this problem  quickly. Written information is in most cases sufficient to help parents  introduce the new evening routines.

TI Short-term studies underestimate 30-generation changes in a butterfly
SO Proceedings. Biological sciences
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB Most studies of rare and endangered species are based on work carried out within  one generation, or over one to a few generations of the study organism. We report  the results of a study that spans 30 generations (years) of the entire natural  range of a butterfly race that is endemic to 35 km(2) of north Wales, UK.  Short-term studies (surveys in single years and dynamics over 4 years) of this  system led to the prediction that the regional distribution would be quite  stable, and that colonization and extinction dynamics would be relatively  unimportant. However, a longer-term study revealed unexpectedly high levels of  population turnover (local extinction and colonization), affecting 18 out of the  20 patches that were occupied at any time during the period. Modelling the system  (using the 'incidence function model' (IFM) for metapopulations) also showed  higher levels of colonization and extinction with increasing duration of the  study. The longer-term dynamics observed in this system can be compared, at a  metapopulation level, with the increased levels of variation observed with  increasing time that have been observed in single populations. Long-term changes  may arise from local changes in the environment that make individual patches more  or less suitable for the butterfly, or from unusual colonization or extinction  events that take metapopulations into alternative states. One implication is that  metapopulation and population viability analyses based on studies that cover only  a few animal or plant generations may underestimate extinction threats.

TI Sperm competition and the dynamics of X chromosome drive: stability and
SO Genetics
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB Several empirical studies of sperm competition in populations polymorphic for a  driving X chromosome have revealed that Sex-ratio males (those carrying a driving  X) are at a disadvantage relative to Standard males. Because the frequency of the  driving X chromosome determines the population-level sex ratio and thus alters  male and female mating rates, the evolutionary consequences of sperm competition  for sex chromosome meiotic drive are subtle. As the SR allele increases in  frequency, the ratio of females to males also increases, causing an increase in  the male mating rate and a decrease in the female mating rate. While the former  change may exacerbate the disadvantage of Sex-ratio males during sperm  competition, the latter change decreases the incidence of sperm competition  within the population. We analyze a model of the effects of sperm competition on  a driving X chromosome and show that these opposing trends in male and female  mating rates can result in two coexisting locally stable equilibria, one  corresponding to a balanced polymorphism of the SR and ST alleles and the second  to fixation of the ST allele. Stochastic fluctuations of either the population  sex ratio or the SR frequency can then drive the population away from the  balanced polymorphism and into the basin of attraction for the second  equilibrium, resulting in fixation of the SR allele and extinction of the  population.

TI Ascent of dinosaurs linked to an iridium anomaly at the Triassic-Jurassic
SO Science (New York, N.Y.)

DT Journal Article
AB Analysis of tetrapod footprints and skeletal material from more than 70  localities in eastern North America shows that large theropod dinosaurs appeared  less than 10,000 years after the Triassic-Jurassic boundary and less than 30,000  years after the last Triassic taxa, synchronous with a terrestrial mass  extinction. This extraordinary turnover is associated with an iridium anomaly (up  to 285 parts per trillion, with an average maximum of 141 parts per trillion) and  a fern spore spike, suggesting that a bolide impact was the cause. Eastern North  American dinosaurian diversity reached a stable maximum less than 100,000 years  after the boundary, marking the establishment of dinosaur-dominated communities  that prevailed for the next 135 million years.

TI Phylogeography and history of giant Galápagos tortoises.
SO Evolution; international journal of organic evolution
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB We examined the phylogeography and history of giant Galápagos tortoise  populations based on mitochondrial DNA sequence data from 161 individuals from 21  sampling sites representing the 11 currently recognized extant taxa. Molecular  clock and geological considerations indicate a founding of the monophyletic  Galápagos lineage around 2-3 million years ago, which would allow for all the  diversification to have occurred on extant islands. Founding events generally  occurred from geologically older to younger islands with some islands colonized  more than once. Six of the 11 named taxa can be associated with monophyletic  maternal lineages. One, Geochelone porteri on Santa Cruz Island, consists of two  distinct populations connected by the deepest node in the archipelago-wide  phylogeny, whereas tortoises in northwest Santa Cruz are closely related to those  on adjacent Pinzón Island. Volcan Wolf, the northernmost volcano of Isabela  Island, consists of both a unique set of maternal lineages and recent migrants  from other islands, indicating multiple colonizations possibly due to human  transport or multiple colonization and partial elimination through competition.  These genetic findings are consistent with the mixed morphology of tortoises on  this volcano. No clear genetic differentiation between two taxa on the two  southernmost volcanoes of Isabela was evident. Extinction of crucial populations  by human activities confounds whether domed versus saddleback carapaces of  different populations are mono- or polyphyletic. Our findings revealed a complex  phylogeography and history for this tortoise radiation within an insular  environment and have implications for efforts to conserve these endangered  biological treasures.

TI Population extinction and recolonization in human demographic history.
SO Mathematical biosciences
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB For over 30 years, a debate has raged among anthropologists about the origins of  anatomically modern humans. At first the debate centered on fossil evidence, but  in the past 10-15 years population geneticists have entered the fray. One model,  the multiregional evolution model, posits a gradual transition from Homo erectus  to anatomically modern humans throughout the Old World. In contrast, the recent  African origin model hypothesizes that anatomically modern humans arose from a  small, isolated population in Africa, spread out of Africa, and replaced  indigenous H. erectus populations in Eurasia and Australasia. A primary  objection, from a population genetics perspective, to the multiregional model is  that the genetic data suggest a small effective population size for humans. This  effective size is on the order of 10,000. Effective population size has a complex  relationship with census size, but it has been argued that, assuming that  effective size is roughly equal to the number of breeding individuals in human  populations under standard demographic conditions, 10,000 breeding individuals  could not have occupied much of the Old World throughout the Pleistocene and  remained a cohesive species via gene flow. However, this argument is not valid if  one considers population extinction and recolonization, which might have played  an important role in human history during the Pleistocene. With population  extinction and recolonization, the inbreeding effective population size can be  small and the census size extremely large. In this paper, I will show that under  conditions of population extinction and recolonization, an effective population  size of 10,000 suggested by genetic data is compatible with a large census size  consistent with the multiregional model.

TI Population dynamics of clock-controlled biological species: models and why
SO Journal of theoretical biology
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB Conventional models of population dynamics of biological species do not take into  account the fact that activity of most living organisms is under control of  biological clocks, which are oscillators with periods near 1 day, 1 year, and so  on. Here proposed are new categories of population dynamics models which are  combinations of Lotka-Volterra type of equations (as a simplest example; in fact,  an arbitrary type may be used) and equations of the biological oscillators. Such  models may be particularly useful in addressing to those problems which are  inaccessible with conventional models. A simple example of such models with  distributed clock periods is proposed and studied numerically and analytically to  consider why periods of biological rhythms are not precisely one day or one year,  etc., as is often questioned. For this purpose, a notion of survival index is  introduced to measure the degree of success in survival. It turns out that clock  periods equal or close to that of the milieu are not necessarily advantageous for  survival and can even lead to extinction; survival is then most successful at the  edge of entrainment. This may provide a clue to answer the question. It is also  found that survival is difficult for those species which cannot be entrained by  the environmental cycle.

Crop and pasture land has replaced their forest habitat, and human introductions  of predators and diseases, particularly of mosquitoes and avian malaria, has  eliminated them from the remaining low- and mid-elevation forests. Landscape  analyses of three high-elevation forest refuges show that anthropogenic climate  change is likely to combine with past land-use changes and biological invasions  to drive several of the remaining species to extinction, especially on the  islands of Kauai and Hawaii.

TI Spatially structured metapopulation models: global and local assessment of
SO Theoretical population biology
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB We model metapopulation dynamics in finite networks of discrete habitat patches  with given areas and spatial locations. We define and analyze two simple and  ecologically intuitive measures of the capacity of the habitat patch network to  support a viable metapopulation. Metapopulation persistence capacity lambda(M)  defines the threshold condition for long-term metapopulation persistence as  lambda(M)>delta, where delta is defined by the extinction and colonization rate  parameters of the focal species. Metapopulation invasion capacity lambda(I) sets  the condition for successful invasion of an empty network from one small local  population as lambda(I)>delta. The metapopulation capacities lambda(M) and  lambda(I) are defined as the leading eigenvalue or a comparable quantity of an  appropriate "landscape" matrix. Based on these definitions, we present a  classification of a very general class of deterministic, continuous-time and  discrete-time metapopulation models. Two specific models are analyzed in greater  detail: a spatially realistic version of the continuous-time Levins model and the  discrete-time incidence function model with propagule size-dependent colonization  rate and a rescue effect. In both models we assume that the extinction rate  increases with decreasing patch area and that the colonization rate increases  with patch connectivity. In the spatially realistic Levins model, the two types  of metapopulation capacities coincide, whereas the incidence function model  possesses a strong Allee effect characterized by lambda(I)=0. For these two  models, we show that the metapopulation capacities can be considered as simple  sums of contributions from individual habitat patches, given by the elements of  the leading eigenvector or comparable quantities. We may therefore assess the  significance of particular habitat patches, including new patches that might be  added to the network, for the metapopulation capacities of the network as a  whole. We derive useful approximations for both the threshold conditions and the  equilibrium states in the two models. The metapopulation capacities and the  measures of the dynamic significance of particular patches can be calculated for  real patch networks for applications in metapopulation ecology, landscape  ecology, and conservation biology.

TI An experimental examination of colonization as a generator of biotic nestedness.
SO Oecologia
LA English
DT Journal Article
DE Australia; Faunal subsets; Invertebrates; Lakes; Stony substrates
AB Species assemblages of systems of islands and other fragmented habitats  frequently show a "nested-subset" structure in which the biotas of sites with low  species richness are non-random subsets of the biotas of richer sites. Much  literature suggests that extinction is more likely to produce strongly nested  patterns than colonization, although very few experiments have been conducted on  the generation of nested-subset patterns. Here, we describe an experiment on  nestedness of benthic invertebrates occupying rocks in the littoral zone of a  lake in western Victoria, Australia. Data collected from previous work indicated  that the invertebrate biotas of rocks were nested. We used initially defaunated,  different-sized habitat patches (half house-bricks, full house-bricks, double  house-bricks) and followed the time-course of occupation to assess whether  nested-subset patterns would emerge, and whether extinction or colonization best  accounted for the patterns. We predicted that nestedness would increase through  time up to the end of the experiment. This was found to be the case with  colonization dominating the establishment of a strongly nested system; extinction  appeared to be of relatively little importance over the duration of the  experiment. These results suggest that at least in some circumstances,  differential colonization may be influential in producing nested-subset patterns  but experiments conducted over longer times may be needed to more completely  understand the respective roles of extinction and colonization in generating  nested-subset patterns in this system.

TI Extinction and the loss of functional diversity.
SO Proceedings. Biological sciences
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB Although it is widely thought to influence ecosystem processes, there is little  consensus on an appropriate measure of functional diversity. The two major  perspectives, to date, are to assume that every species is functionally unique,  or to assume that some species are functionally identical, such that functional  groups exist. Using a continuous measure of functional diversity (FD) derived  from the quantitative functional traits of species, we show that the loss of  functional diversity from six natural assemblages was rapid compared with rates  of loss from comparable simulated assemblages. Loss of FD occurred faster than  loss of functional-group diversity in four of the six natural assemblages.  Patterns of functional-group diversity loss depended on the number of functional  groups and the number of species in an assemblage. Extinctions that occurred  first for species with particular traits (e.g. low leaf nitrogen concentration,  deep roots and large body size) caused greater loss of FD than expected by chance  in four of the six natural assemblages. In two real assemblages, these  trait-dependent extinctions had more severe effects on FD than our simulated  worst-case extinction scenario. These data suggest that conserving a large  proportion of the functional traits of species requires conserving a large  proportion of all species.

TI The rise and fall of SRY.
SO Trends in genetics : TIG
LA English
DT Review
AB Comparisons between species reveal when and how SRY, the testis-determining gene,  evolved. SRY is younger than the Y chromosome, and so was probably not the  original mammal sex-determining gene that defined the Y. SRY is typical of genes  on the Y chromosome. It arose from a gene on the proto-sex chromosome pair with a  function (possibly brain-determination) in both sexes. It has been buffeted in  evolution, and shows variation in copy number, structure and expression. And it  is dispensable, having been lost at least twice independently in different rodent  lineages. At the observed rate of attrition, the human Y chromosome will be gone  in 5-10 million years. This could lead to the extinction of our species or to a  burst of hominid speciation.

TI A persistence criterion for metapopulations.
SO Theoretical population biology
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB Simple conditions to evaluate the persistence of populations living in fragmented  habitats are of primary importance in ecology. We address this need here using a  spatially implicit approach that accounts for discrete individuals in a  metapopulation. Demographic stochasticity is incorporated into a Markovian model  in a natural way, as local extinction is characterized by the death or the  dispersal of the last individual inhabiting a patch. The variables of the model  are the probabilities p(i) (i=0, 1, 2...) that a patch be occupied by a finite,  integer number i of individuals at a given time. We compare the stationary  distributions predicted by the model with field data and discuss the role of  dispersal in determining different distributions of local abundances. The  analysis of the model leads to a persistence criterion which is equivalent to a  condition formerly proved by Chesson (Z. Wahrscheinlichkeitstheor. 66, 97-107,  1984) namely that E(0)>1, where E(0) is the expected number of successful  dispersers from a patch begun with one individual and to which immigration is  excluded. We provide an analytic way of computing E(0) as a function of the main  biological characteristics of the species (natality, mortality and dispersal  rates, and colonizing ability). We can thus obtain persistence-extinction  boundaries in the space of model parameters.

TI The fossil record of North American mammals: evidence for a Paleocene
SO Systematic biology
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB Paleontologists long have argued that the most important evolutionary radiation  of mammals occurred during the early Cenozoic, if not that all eutherians  originated from a single common post-Cretaceous ancestor. Nonetheless, several  recent molecular analyses claim to show that because several interordinal splits  occurred during the Cretaceous, a major therian radiation was then underway. This  claim conflicts with statistical evidence from the well-sampled latest Cretaceous  and Cenozoic North American fossil record. Paleofaunal data confirm that there  were fewer mammalian species during the latest Cretaceous than during any  interval of the Cenozoic, and that a massive diversification took place during  the early Paleocene, immediately after a mass extinction. Measurement data show  that Cretaceous mammals were on average small and occupied a narrow range of body  sizes; after the Cretaceous-Tertiary mass extinction, there was a rapid and  permanent shift in the mean. The fact that there was an early Cenozoic mammalian  radiation is entirely compatible with the existence of a few Cretaceous splits  among modern mammal lineages.

TI Life-history correlates of maximum population growth rates in marine fishes.
SO Proceedings. Biological sciences
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB Theory predicts that populations of animals with late maturity, low fecundity,  large body size and low body growth rates will have low potential rates of  population increase at low abundance. If this is true, then these traits may be  used to predict the intrinsic rate of increase for species or populations, as  well as extinction risks. We used life-history and population data for 63 stocks  of commercially exploited fish species from the northeast Atlantic to test  relationships between life-history parameters and the rate of population increase  at low abundance. We used cross-taxonomic analyses among stocks and among  species, and analyses that accounted for phylogenetic relationships. These  analyses confirmed that large-bodied, slow-growing stocks and species had  significantly lower rates of recruitment and adult production per spawning adult  at low abundance. Furthermore, high ages at maturity were significantly  correlated with low maximum recruit production. Contrary to expectation,  fecundity was significantly negatively related to recruit production, due to its  positive relationship with maximum body size. Our results support theoretical  predictions, and suggest that a simply measured life-history parameter can  provide a useful tool for predicting rates of recovery from low population  abundance.

TI Evolutionary suicide and evolution of dispersal in structured metapopulations.
SO Journal of mathematical biology
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB We study the evolution of dispersal in a structured metapopulation model. The  metapopulation consists of a large (infinite) number of local populations living  in patches of habitable environment. Dispersal between patches is modelled by a  disperser pool and individuals in transit between patches are exposed to a risk  of mortality. Occasionally, local catastrophes eradicate a local population: all  individuals in the affected patch die, yet the patch remains habitable. We prove  that, in the absence of catastrophes, the strategy not to migrate is  evolutionarily stable. Under a given set of environmental conditions, a  metapopulation may be viable and yet selection may favor dispersal rates that  drive the metapopulation to extinction. This phenomenon is known as evolutionary  suicide. We show that in our model evolutionary suicide can occur for catastrophe  rates that increase with decreasing local population size. Evolutionary suicide  can also happen for constant catastrophe rates, if local growth within patches  shows an Allee effect. We study the evolutionary bifurcation towards evolutionary  suicide and show that a discontinuous transition to extinction is a necessary  condition for evolutionary suicide to occur. In other words, if population size  smoothly approaches zero at a boundary of viability in parameter space, this  boundary is evolutionarily repelling and no suicide can occur.

AB The validity of Raunkiaer's biological types (or life-forms) was tested on native  Corsican flora, using criteria of altitudinal distribution and rarity. The  biological basis of this classification has been widely confirmed. The analysis  of floras from Corsica and Provence revealed the major role played by both  altitude and human impact, and also demonstrated the importance of the predictive  value of life-forms to plant conservation. In Southeastern France, there are no  clear proportional relationships between rarity and extinction percentages. With  increasing levels of human activity, rarity percentages are seen to increase for  nearly all types. Conversely, extinction percentages exhibit a clear progression  only for the most threatened life-forms: bulb and tuber geophytes, therophytes,  parasites and especially hydrophytes. Thus, priority should be given to the  protection of these 4 herbaceous types, which are found at low altitudes and lack  visible vegetative organs during the unfavourable season.

TI Age rank/clade rank metrics--sampling, taxonomy, and the meaning of
SO Systematic biology
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB Paleontologists frequently contrast clade rank (i.e., nodal or patristic distance  from the base of a cladogram) with age rank (i.e., relative first known  appearances of the analyzed taxa) to measure the degree of congruence between the  estimated phylogeny and the fossil record. Although some potential biases of  these methods have been examined (e.g., the effect of tree imbalance), other  properties of age rank/clade rank (ARCR) comparisons have not been studied in  detail. A basic premise of ARCR metrics is that outgroup taxa diverged earlier  than ingroups and thus should first appear in older strata. For example, given  phylogeny (A,(B,C)), then taxon A should be sampled before either taxon B or  taxon C. We examine this premise in the context of (1) phylogenetic theory, (2)  taxonomic practice, (3) sampling intensity (R), and (4) factors other than  sampling intensity (including cladogram accuracy). Simulations combining clade  evolution and sampling over time indicate a poor relationship between ARCR  metrics and R when all taxa are apomorphy-based monophyletic groups. However, a  good relationship exists when taxa are either stem-based monophyletic groups or  if workers include taxa without a priori decisions about monophyly or paraphyly.  These results are not surprising because cladograms predict the order in which  lineages diverged (which applies to stem-based monophyletic taxa) and the order  in which morphologic grades appeared (which applies to paraphyletic taxa relative  to derived monophyletic groups). Other factors that increase ARCR metrics when  the average R stays the same include high temporal variation in R, budding  instead of bifurcating speciation patterns, low extinction rates, cladogram  inaccuracy, and (to a much lesser extent) large clade size. These results suggest  several plausible explanations for patterned differences in ARCR metrics among  clades, thereby compromising their validity as measures of the quality of the  fossil record.

SO Evolution; international journal of organic evolution
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB As the ultimate source of genetic variation, spontaneous mutation is essential to  evolutionary change. Theoretical studies over several decades have revealed the  dependence of evolutionary consequences of mutation on specific mutational  properties, including genomic mutation rates, U, and the effects of newly arising  mutations on individual fitness, s. The recent resurgence of empirical effort to  infer these properties for diverse organisms has not achieved consensus.  Estimates, which have been obtained by methods that assume mutations are  unidirectional in their effects on fitness, are imprecise. Both because a general  approach must allow for occurrence of fitness-enhancing mutations, even if these  are rare, and because recent evidence demands it, we present a new method for  inferring mutational parameters. For the distribution of mutational effects, we  retain Keightley's assumption of the gamma distribution, to take advantage of the  flexibility of its shape. Because the conventional gamma is one sided,  restricting it to unidirectional effects, we include an additional parameter,  rho, as an amount it is displaced from zero. Estimation is accomplished by Markov  chain Monte Carlo maximum likelihood. Through a limited set of simulations, we  verify the accuracy of this approach. We apply it to analyze data on two  reproductive fitness components from a 17-generation mutation-accumulation study  of a Columbia accession of Arabidopsis thaliana in which 40 lines sampled in  three generations were assayed simultaneously. For these traits, U  approximately/= 0.1-0.2, with distributions of mutational effects broadly  spanning zero, such that roughly half the mutations reduce reproductive fitness.  One evolutionary consequence of these results is lower extinction risks of small  populations of A. thaliana than expected from the process of mutational meltdown.  A comprehensive view of the evolutionary consequences of mutation will depend on  quantitatively accounting for fitness-enhancing, as well as fitness-reducing,  mutations.

TI Species positions and extinction dynamics in simple food webs.
SO Journal of theoretical biology
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB Recent investigations on the structure of complex networks have provided  interesting results for ecologists. Being inspired by these studies, we analyse a  well-defined set of small model food webs. The extinction probability caused by  internal Lotka-Volterra dynamics is compared to the position of species.  Simulations have revealed that some global properties of these food webs (e.g.  the homogeneity of connectedness) and the positions of species therein (e.g.  interaction pattern) make them prone to modelled biotic extinction caused by  population dynamical effects. We found that: (a) homogeneity in the connectedness  structure increases the probability of extinction events; (b) in addition to the  number of interactions, their orientations also influence the future of species  in a web. Since species in characteristic network positions are prone to  extinction, results could also be interpreted as describing the properties of  preferred states of food webs during community assembly. Our results may  contribute to understanding the intimate relationship between pattern and process  in ecology.

SO Proceedings. Biological sciences
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB Ever since the pattern of localized extinction associated with measles was  discovered by Bartlett in 1957, many models have been developed in an attempt to  reproduce this phenomenon. Recently, the use of constant infectious and  incubation periods, rather than the more convenient exponential forms, has been  presented as a simple means of obtaining realistic persistence levels. However,  this result appears at odds with rigorous mathematical theory; here we reconcile  these differences. Using a deterministic approach, we parameterize a variety of  models to fit the observed biennial attractor, thus determining the level of  seasonality by the choice of model. We can then compare fairly the persistence of  the stochastic versions of these models, using the 'best-fit' parameters.  Finally, we consider the differences between the observed fade-out pattern and  the more theoretically appealing 'first passage time'.

TI Determinants of extinction in the fossil record.
SO Nature
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB The causes of mass extinctions and the nature of biological selectivity at  extinction events are central questions in palaeobiology. It has long been  recognized, however, that the amount of sedimentary rock available for sampling  may bias perceptions of biodiversity and estimates of taxonomic rates of  evolution. This problem has been particularly noted with respect to the principal  mass extinctions. Here we use a new compilation of the amount of exposed marine  sedimentary rock to predict how the observed fossil record of extinction would  appear if the time series of true extinction rates were in fact smooth. Many  features of the highly variable record of apparent extinction rates within marine  animals can be predicted on the basis of temporal variation in the amount of  exposed rock. Although this result is consistent with the possibility that a  common geological cause determines both true extinction rates and the amount of  exposed rock, it also supports the hypothesis that much of the observed  short-term volatility in extinction rates is an artefact of variability in the  stratigraphic record.

TI Single-species models of the Allee effect: extinction boundaries, sex ratios and
SO Journal of theoretical biology
LA English
DT Review
AB We critically review and classify models of single-species population dynamics  subject to the demographic Allee effect with emphasis on non-spatial,  deterministic approach. Inclusion of spatial movement and stochastic phenomena  does not substantially change the behaviour; stochasticity only "blurs" step-like  character of the Allee effect into a sigmoidal form. The outcome of all  non-spatial, deterministic models is either unconditional extinction,  extinction-survival scenario (ES), or unconditional survival. Three major model  classes are recognized: (1) one-dimensional heuristic models, (2) one-dimensional  models with mating probability and fixed sex ratio, and (3) two-sex models with  variable adult sex ratio. Each class is characterized by the shape of extinction  boundary which separates extinction from survival in the ES scenario. The latter  two classes may give better predictions of extinction thresholds than heuristic  models but require specific information and are data intensive. In  one-dimensional models with fixed sex ratio, population cannot survive if  density/number of males decreases below some threshold while there is no such  restriction on females. Individual-based models seem to be most capable of  explaining mechanisms leading to the Allee effect.

TI Bird-like fossil footprints from the Late Triassic.
SO Nature
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB The study of fossilized footprints and tracks of dinosaurs and other vertebrates  has provided insight into the origin, evolution and extinction of several major  groups and their behaviour; it has also been an important complement to their  body fossil record. The known history of birds starts in the Late Jurassic epoch  (around 150 Myr ago) with the record of Archaeopteryx, whereas the coelurosaurian  ancestors of the birds date back to the Early Jurassic. The hind limbs of Late  Triassic epoch theropods lack osteological evidence for an avian reversed hallux  and also display other functional differences from birds. Previous references to  suggested Late Triassic to Early Jurassic bird-like footprints have been  reinterpreted as produced by non-avian dinosaurs having a high angle between  digits II and IV and in all cases their avian affinities have been challenged.  Here we describe well-preserved and abundant footprints with clearly avian  characters from a Late Triassic redbed sequence of Argentina, at least 55 Myr  before the first known skeletal record of birds. These footprints document the  activities, in an environment interpreted as small ponds associated with  ephemeral rivers, of an unknown group of Late Triassic theropods having some  avian characters.

TI Rapid prehistoric extinction of iguanas and birds in Polynesia.
SO Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB The Tongoleleka archaeological site on Lifuka Island, Kingdom of Tonga, is a rich  accumulation of pottery, marine mollusks, and nonhuman bones that represents  first human contact on a small island in Remote Oceania approximately 2,850 years  ago. The lower strata contain decorated Lapita-style pottery and bones of an  extinct iguana (Brachylophus undescribed sp.) and numerous species of extinct  birds. The upper strata instead feature Polynesian Plainware pottery and bones of  extant species of vertebrates. A stratigraphic series of 20 accelerator-mass  spectrometer radiocarbon dates on individual bones of the iguana, an extinct  megapode (Megapodius alimentum), and the non-native chicken (Gallus gallus)  suggests that anthropogenic loss of the first two species and introduction of the  latter occurred on Lifuka within a time interval too short (a century or less) to  be resolved by radiometric dating. The geologically instantaneous prehistoric  collapse of Lifuka's vertebrate community contrasts with the much longer periods  of faunal depletion on some other islands, thus showing that the elapse time  between human arrival and major extinction events was highly variable on oceanic  islands as well as on continents.

TI Impacts of Oreochromis mossambicus (Perciformes: Cichlidae) upon habitat
SO Revista de biologia tropical
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB Five species of Cyprinodon in Laguna Chichancanab, Yucatan, Mexico comprise a  young species flock whose ecology and evolution has not been thoroughly studied,  but whose existence is threatened with extinction. Species flocks evolve in  isolated areas where predators and competitors are absent. Since the description  of the Chichancanab flock, Oreochromis mossambicus, a species introduced into the  lake for which I examined habitat in the 1980's, has become common throughout the  basin. I assessed relative abundance of flock species in the lake. examined  habitat use and segregation among the three most common flock species and  examined the affects of O. mossambicus upon flock species habitat use. Cyprinodon  beltrani was the most abundant flock species in 1997, followed by C. maya and C.  labiosus; C. verecundus and C. simus were rare. Cyprinodon beltrani was found in  shallow water, nearshore, over thick beds of submerged Chara, and little emergent  vegetation. Cyprinodon beltrani exhibited diurnal variation in nearshore habitat  use. In the field, the habitat use of C. beltrani and O. mossambicus broadly  overlapped. In aquarium experiments, three flock species exhibited habitat use  segregation and C. beltrani and C. labiosus showed agonistic behaviors that  strengthened segregation. Cyprinodon maya differed from C. beltrani and C.  labiosus by its greater dispersion of individuals and use of areas higher in the  water column. The presence of O. mossambicus caused a shift in habitat use by C.  maya and C. labiosus that put these species into habitat occupied by C. beltrani.  The presence of introduced species has caused a significant perturbation of the  conditions that fomented speciation of the Chichancanab flock 8,000 years ago.

TI Importance of hybridization between indigenous and nonindigenous freshwater
SO Systematic biology
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB Biodiversity of North American freshwaters is among the greatest in the world.  However, due to extensive habitat degradation, pollution, and introductions of  nonindigenous species, this biodiversity is also among the most endangered.  Unlike habitat degradation and pollution, nonindigenous species represent a  permanent loss of biodiversity because their removal or control is often  impossible. Most species introduced into nonnative North American ranges,  however, are not from Eurasia but have been introduced from geographically  isolated regions within North America. Although the ecological effects of  introduced species have been widely documented, the effects of hybridization,  especially between closely related species, represents an equally serious  mechanism of extinction but is much less studied. Identification of which species  are likely to hybridize after contact is of critical importance to prevent the  further loss of native species. Molecular phylogenetics serves as a powerful tool  to identify freshwater species at risk of introgression, if we can assume that  genetic distance is a good predictor of the potential for hybridization. Although  not a thorough review of all cases of hybridization, this article documents the  extent and effects of hybridization in fishes, crayfishes, mussels, and other  invertebrates in light of the currently accepted phylogenetic relationships. We  suggest this approach may be the first step in addressing the potential threat of  hybridization between many of the closely related species in North American fresh  waters.

TI Interactions in a tritrophic acarine predator-prey metapopulation system IV:
SO Experimental & applied acarology
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB Feeding by spider mites can cause severe injury to a host plant and lead to a  decreasing per capita growth rate and an increasing per capita emigration rate.  Such density-dependent responses to local conditions are important in a  metapopulation context because they allow the herbivores to colonize new host  plants and thereby prolong the time until regional (metapopulation) extinction.  In order to include density-dependent responses of the two-spotted spider mite  (Tetranychus urticae) in a realistic metapopulation model, a series of greenhouse  experiments was conducted with the purpose to quantify how the condition of bean  plants (Phaseolus vulgaris) influences the demographic parameters of T. urticae.  Plant age per se reduced the growth rate of the spider mites only slightly,  whereas the growth rate declined significantly as the plants were injured by the  mites. The relationships between plant condition (expressed by the plant injury  index D) and the birth and loss (death + emigration) rates of the mites were  quantified so as to predict population growth as a function of D. Maximum per  capita growth rate (r) was estimated to be c. 0.21 day(-1). The growth rate is  expected to be negative when D exceeds 0.8. When mites were allowed to emigrate  to neighbouring plants via bridges, the per capita emigration rate increased  almost exponentially with D. The proportion of eggs in the population decreased  with D while the numerical ratio between immatures to adults and the sex ratio  did not change with D. Overall, immatures and adults constituted 74% and 26%,  respectively, of the active mites and c. 46% of the adults were males. The  bridges that connected a donor plant with the surrounding recipient plants were  responsible for the majority of the emigrations from donor plants. Most mites  stopped after having crossed a single bridge, but a few crossed two bridges while  none crossed three bridges within 24 h. The significance of the results for  biological control is discussed.

TI Large extinctions in an evolutionary model: the role of innovation and keystone
SO Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB The causes of major and rapid transitions observed in biological macroevolution  as well as in the evolution of social systems are a subject of much debate. Here  we identify the proximate causes of crashes and recoveries that arise dynamically  in a model system in which populations of (molecular) species coevolve with their  network of chemical interactions. Crashes are events that involve the rapid  extinction of many species, and recoveries the assimilation of new ones. These  are analyzed and classified in terms of the structural properties of the network.  We find that in the absence of large external perturbation, "innovation" is a  major cause of large extinctions and the prime cause of recoveries. Another major  cause of crashes is the extinction of a "keystone species." Different classes of  causes produce crashes of different characteristic sizes.

TI O-4-Linked coniferyl and sinapyl aldehydes in lignifying cell walls are the main
SO Protoplasma
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB The nature and specificity of the Wiesner test (phloroglucinol-HCl reagent) for  the aromatic aldehyde fraction contained in lignins is studied. Phloroglucinol  reacted in ethanol-hydrochloric acid with coniferyl aldehyde, sinapyl aldehyde,  vanillin, and syringaldehyde to yield either pink pigments (in the case of  hydroxycinnamyl aldehydes) or red-brown pigments (in the case of  hydroxybenzaldehydes). However, coniferyl alcohol, sinapyl alcohol, and highly  condensed dehydrogenation polymers derived from these cinnamyl alcohols and  aldehydes did not react with phloroglucinol in ethanol-hydrochloric acid. The  differences in the reactivity of phloroglucinol with hydroxycinnamyl aldehydes  and their dehydrogenation polymers may be explained by the fact that, in the  latter, the unsubstituted (alpha,beta-unsaturated) cinnamaldehyde functional  group, which is responsible for the dye reaction, is lost due to lateral chain  cross-linking reactions involving the beta carbon. Fourier transform infrared  spectroscopy and thioacidolysis analyses of phloroglucinol-positive lignifying  plant cell walls belonging to the plant species Zinnia elegans L., Capsicum  annuumvar. annuum, Populus albaL., and Pinus halepensisL. demonstrated the  presence of 4- O-linked hydroxycinnamyl aldehyde end groups and 4- O-linked  4-hydroxy-3-methoxy-benzaldehyde (vanillin) end groups in lignins. However, given  the relatively low abundance of 4- O-linked vanillin in lignifying cell walls and  the low extinction coefficient of its red-brown phloroglucinol adduct, it is  unlikely that vanillin contributes to a great extent to the  phloroglucinol-positive stain reaction. These results suggest that the  phloroglucinol-HCl pink stain of lignifying xylem cell walls actually reveals the  4- O-linked hydroxycinnamyl aldehyde structures contained in lignins.  Histochemical studies showed that these aldehyde structures are assembled, as in  the case of coniferyl aldehyde, during the early stages of xylem cell wall  lignification.

TI An atmospheric pCO2 reconstruction across the Cretaceous-Tertiary boundary from
SO Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB The end-Cretaceous mass extinctions, 65 million years ago, profoundly influenced  the course of biotic evolution. These extinctions coincided with a major  extraterrestrial impact event and massive volcanism in India. Determining the  relative importance of each event as a driver of environmental and biotic change  across the Cretaceous-Tertiary boundary (KTB) crucially depends on constraining  the mass of CO(2) injected into the atmospheric carbon reservoir. Using the  inverse relationship between atmospheric CO(2) and the stomatal index of land  plant leaves, we reconstruct Late Cretaceous-Early Tertiary atmospheric CO(2)  concentration (pCO(2)) levels with special emphasis on providing a pCO(2)  estimate directly above the KTB. Our record shows stable Late Cretaceous/Early  Tertiary background pCO(2) levels of 350-500 ppm by volume, but with a marked  increase to at least 2,300 ppm by volume within 10,000 years of the KTB.  Numerical simulations with a global biogeochemical carbon cycle model indicate  that CO(2) outgassing during the eruption of the Deccan Trap basalts fails to  fully account for the inferred pCO(2) increase. Instead, we calculate that the  postboundary pCO(2) rise is most consistent with the instantaneous transfer of  approximately 4,600 Gt C from the lithic to the atmospheric reservoir by a large  extraterrestrial bolide impact. A resultant climatic forcing of +12 W.m(-2) would  have been sufficient to warm the Earth's surface by approximately 7.5 degrees C,  in the absence of counter forcing by sulfate aerosols. This finding reinforces  previous evidence for major climatic warming after the KTB impact and implies  that severe and abrupt global warming during the earliest Paleocene was an  important factor in biotic extinction at the KTB.

TI Optimal conservation effort for a population in a stochastic environment.
SO Journal of theoretical biology
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB We study the optimal conservation effort for a population in a fluctuating  environment. The survivorship of a population is affected by unpredictable  environmental fluctuation (noise) and can be improved by conservation effort  accompanied by a cost. The optimal effort level is the one that minimizes the  total cost, defined as the weighted sum of the population extinction risk and the  economic cost of conservation effort. The optimal effort depends on the variance  and the probability distribution of the noise, the relative importance of the  population's survival vs. the economic cost, the effectiveness of conservation  effort, and the time scope over which we optimize. The analysis of dynamic  programming illustrates that the choice of extinction risk function greatly  affects the optimal effort level. The conservation effort level that is the best  solution of a multiple-year optimization may be higher than that for the  corresponding single-year optimization, if the population is relatively safe.  However, the conservation level for the multiple-year optimization becomes lower  than for the single-year optimization if the population is endangered. In a  similar manner, the optimal conservation effort level for the problem with a  short time scope is either higher or lower than that for the problem with a long  time scope, depending on the extinction risk of the population. Next, for each  parameter of the model, we define five different sensitivities of extinction  probability or of the total cost. We then study the mean increase in the total  cost caused by the uncertainty of parameters. To achieve the best conservation  result, we need to invest the limited research effort to the parameter with the  largest effect to the optimal effort level, rather than to those with large  impacts on the extinction probability or on the total cost. The recommended  policy should depend critically on the choice of the criterion to optimize, which  shows the importance of theoretical study of the relationship in performing  proper decision making in conservation practice.

TI Phylogeny, taxonomy, genetics and global heritage ranks of an imperilled,
SO Molecular ecology
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB Numerous aquatic species are threatened with extinction from habitat elimination  or modification. One particularly imperilled group is the freshwater gastropod  family Pleuroceridae. Pleurocerids reach their greatest diversity in the  southeastern United States, and many species are currently considered extinct,  endangered or threatened. One issue hindering efforts to implement conservation  management plans for imperilled pleurocerid species is that the taxonomy is in an  abysmal state. The taxonomy of pleurocerids is currently based on late 19th- and  early 20th-century studies, which used a typological or morphospecies concept.  Most biologists today doubt the validity of many of the currently recognized  species; however, this does not stop them from assigning conservation ranks in an  attempt to determine which species are imperilled or currently stable. We  conducted a phylogenetic analysis of the pleurocerid genus Lithasia using  morphological and mitochondrial DNA sequence (mtDNA) data in an attempt to  delimit species boundaries and test previous taxonomic schemes. We found that the  current taxonomy of Lithasia does not reflect species diversity adequately within  the genus, with two new undescribed species being discovered. The conservation  status ranks of the new, undescribed species are imperilled and would have been  overlooked had we relied on the conventional taxonomy. Additionally, the  undescribed species' conservation ranks that were previously apparently secure  became vulnerable due to being inappropriately assigned as members of formerly  widely distributed species instead of the imperilled status they warrant and vice  versa, as some taxa that were considered imperilled are now thought to be  modestly stable. Our study suggests that conservation ranks should be considered  suspect at best in taxonomically poorly known groups until the taxa are reviewed  using modern systematic methods.

AB Senecio cambrensis is a new allopolyploid species, which originated independently  in North Wales and in Edinburgh, Scotland. Despite extensive searches, the  species has not been found growing at any of its previously recorded sites in  Edinburgh or at other potential sites in the area since 1993. We have concluded  that the Edinburgh lineage of S. cambrensis is now extinct and discuss possible  causes of its extinction. The lineage was present in Edinburgh from at least 1974  and therefore survived in the wild for a minimum of 19 years. The species remains  well established in parts of North Wales.

TI Stimulation of Alexandrium fundyense growth by bacterial assemblages from the Bay
SO Journal of applied microbiology
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB AIMS: To evaluate the influence of marine bacterial assemblages from the Bay of  Fundy on Alexandrium fundyense str. CB301 growth. METHODS AND RESULTS: Bacterial  assemblages were collected from the Bay of Fundy during an Alexandrium spp.  bloom, serially diluted to extinction and inoculated into axenic CB301 cultures.  Bacterial assemblages dramatically enhanced CB301 growth. Retrieval and analysis  of 16S rDNA fragments revealed an Alteromonas sp. strain to be the only  detectable bacterium in all assemblages that promoted A. fundyense and the sole  bacterium found in the most dilute inoculum that promoted A. fundyense. While  this bacterium has not yet been isolated, other isolates obtained from the  assemblages did not stimulate A. fundyense, indicating that the observed  stimulation was not a general effect of marine bacteria. CONCLUSIONS: Bay of  Fundy marine bacterial assemblages dominated by a member of the family  Alteromonadaceae were found to dramatically stimulate growth of A. fundyense.  SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: These results show that native bacteria  have the potential to dramatically promote the growth of A. fundyense and may  play an important role in influencing A. fundyense dynamics in the Bay of Fundy.

TI Simulating species loss following perturbation: assessing the effects on process
SO Proceedings. Biological sciences
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB We removed stream-living macroinvertebrate shredder species in the sequences in  which they are predicted to disappear, in response to two common types of  anthropogenic disturbances: acidification and organic pollution, and analysed the  effects on leaf breakdown rates. The experiment was performed in field microcosms  using three shredder species. Species identity significantly affected leaf  breakdown rates, while species richness per se was non-significant. The simulated  sequential species loss showed large effects on leaf breakdown rates, with  observed rates being significantly higher than expected from single-species  treatments in two, out of four, two-species, and in all four three-species  treatments. The invertebrates used in this study were taxonomically distinct  (Insecta: Plecoptera and Trichoptera; Crustacea: Amphipoda), and of different  sizes, hence a high degree of complementarity was probably present. A method to  study the effects of species loss, characteristic of perturbation type, could be  more useful than a random approach when investigating the impact of perturbation.  Our results may have general applicability for investigations on the effects of  diversity loss on ecosystem functioning in any ecosystem exposed to human  perturbations, given that the order of extinction is known or can easily be  assessed.

TI Landscape-scale spatial population dynamics in human-impacted stream systems.
SO Environmental management
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB The movement of individuals among populations can be critical in preventing local  and landscape-scale species extinctions in systems exposed to human perturbation.  Current understanding of spatial population dynamics in streams is largely  limited to the reach scale and is therefore inadequate to address species  response to spatially extensive perturbation. Using model simulations, I examined  species response to perturbation in a drainage composed of multiple,  hierarchically arranged stream-patches connected by in-stream and overland  pathways of dispersal. Patch extinction probability, the proportion of initially  occupied patches extinct after 25 years, was highly sensitive to the extent of  species occupancy and perturbation within the drainage, longitudinal species  distribution, perturbation decay rate and the covariance pattern of stochastic  effects on colonization and extinction probabilities. Results of these  simulations underscore the importance of identifying and preserving source  populations and dispersal routes for stream species in human-impacted landscapes.  They also highlight the vulnerability of headwater specialist taxa to  anthropogenic perturbation, and the strong positive effect on species resilience  of habitat rehabilitation when recolonization is possible. Efforts to conserve  and manage stream species may be greatly improved by accounting for  landscape-scale spatial population dynamics.

TI Light extinction by fine atmospheric particles in the White Mountains region of
SO The Science of the total environment
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB Chemical, optical, and physical measurements of fine aerosols (aerodynamic  diameter < or = 2.5 microm) have been performed at a mountaintop location  adjacent to the White Mountain National Forest in northern NH, USA. A 1-month  long sampling campaign was conducted at Cranmore Mountain during spring 2000. We  report on the apportionment of light extinction by fine aerosols into its major  chemical components, and relationships between variations in aerosol parameters  and changes in air mass origin. Filter-based, 24-h integrated samples were  collected and analyzed for major inorganic ions, as well as organic (OC),  elemental (EC), and total carbon. Light scattering and light absorption  coefficients were measured at 5-min intervals using an integrating nephelometer  and a light absorption photometer. Fine particle number density was measured with  a condensation particle counter. Air mass origins and transport patterns were  investigated through the use of 3-day backward trajectories and a synoptic  climate classification system. Two distinct transport regimes were observed: (1)  flow from the north/northeast (N/NE) occurred during 9 out of 18 sample-days; and  (2) flow from the west/southwest (W/SW) occurred 8 out of 18 sample-days. All  measured and derived aerosol and meteorological parameters were separated into  two categories based on these different flow scenarios. During W/SW flow, higher  values of aerosol chemical concentration, absorption and scattering coefficients,  number density, and haziness were observed compared to N/NE flow. The highest  level of haziness was associated with the climate classification Frontal Atlantic  Return, which brought polluted air into the region from the mid-Atlantic  corridor. Fine particle mass scattering efficiencies of (NH4)2SO4 and OC were  5.35 +/- 0.42 m2 g(-1) and 1.56 +/- 0.40 m2 g(-1), respectively, when transport  was out of the N/NE. When transport was from the W/SW the values were 4.94 +/-  0.68 m2 g(-1) for (NH4)2SO4 and 2.18 +/- 0.91 m2 g(-1) for OC. EC mass absorption  efficiency when transport was from the N/NE was 9.66 +/- 1.06 m2 g(-1) and 10.80  +/- 1.76 m2 g(-1) when transport was from the W/SW. Results from this work can be  used to predict visual air quality in the White Mountain National Forest based on  a forecasted synoptic climate classification and its associated visibility.

TI Determining the role that ecological and developmental constraints play in
SO Evolution & development
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB It is widely believed that morphological constraints are responsible for the  observed pattern of decreasing major morphological innovation in both the Metazoa  and Metaphytes over geological time. This is readily seen as the decreasing trend  of origination of higher taxa: phyla, classes, and orders. Currently, there are  two competing evolutionary hypotheses that have been proposed to explain this  phenomenon: (1) the empty ecospace hypothesis and (2) the developmental  constraint hypothesis. To distinguish between hypotheses 1 and 2, the change of  morphological innovation before and after several mass extinction events was  measured in the Crinoidea and Blastozoa. Mass extinction intervals provided a  means in which to remove ecospace limiting constraints and allow the  developmental constraint hypothesis to be thoroughly tested. Within the  Crinoidea, disparity was measured before and after three mass extinctions. Within  the Blastozoa, disparity was measured before and after two mass extinctions. For  each taxon, three suites of characters were analyzed: ecological, nonecological,  or "developmental" and a combination of the two previous suites plus 50  additional characters. Four different measures of disparity were used to analyze  each character suite. In the majority of the cases investigated, disparity  rebounds to comparable levels or in some cases higher levels in both the  Crinoidea and Blastozoa. The results indicate that developmental constraints are  not responsible for the decrease in disparity throughout the geologic range of  the taxa. The more likely scenario is that increasingly structured ecological  guilds have made it much more difficult to allow large increases in disparity.

TI 40Ar/39Ar dates from the West Siberian Basin: Siberian flood basalt province
SO Science (New York, N.Y.)
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB Widespread basaltic volcanism occurred in the region of the West Siberian Basin  in central Russia during Permo-Triassic times. New 40Ar/39Ar age determinations  on plagioclase grains from deep boreholes in the basin reveal that the basalts  were erupted 249.4 +/- 0.5 million years ago. This is synchronous with the bulk  of the Siberian Traps, erupted further east on the Siberian Platform. The age and  geochemical data confirm that the West Siberian Basin basalts are part of the  Siberian Traps and at least double the confirmed area of the volcanic province as  a whole. The larger area of volcanism strengthens the link between the volcanism  and the end-Permian mass extinction.

TI The route to extinction: population dynamics of a threatened butterfly.

LA English
DT Journal Article
DE Density dependence and density independence; Euphydryas editha bayensis; Habitat topography; Nonlinear modeling; Persistence time
AB We compare results of field study and model analysis of two butterfly populations  to evaluate the importance of alternative mechanisms causing changes in  abundance. Although understanding and predicting population fluctuations is a  central goal of population ecology, it is not often achieved because long-term  abundance data are available for few populations in which mechanisms causing  fluctuations also are known. Both kinds of information exist for two populations  of the checkerspot butterfly, Euphydryas editha bayensis, which are matched in  most ways except for habitat area and topography. We applied results from field  study to make predictions about the dynamics of the two populations. Then we  tested these predictions using nonlinear modeling of abundance data. Models  included endogenous factors, exogenous effects of weather, or both. Results  showed that the populations differed in variability and responses to endogenous  and exogenous factors. The population in the more homogeneous habitat varied more  widely, went extinct first, and fluctuated more severely with climate. Dynamics  of the population occupying the topographically diverse habitat were more  complex, containing damped oscillations and weaker influences of weather. We draw  four main conclusions. First, the routes to extinction for E. e. bayensis  populations in protected habitat were random walks driven by climatic  variability. Climatic influences dominated both populations, but the timing and  functional forms of climatic effects differed between populations. Second,  topographic diversity reduced weather-induced population variability and  increased persistence time. Third, one must explicitly consider both endogenous  and exogenous components to fully understand population dynamics. Fourth,  resolving the debate over population regulation requires integrating long-term  population sampling, model analysis, and investigation of mechanisms in the  field.

TI Emerging Issues in Population Viability Analysis.
SO Conservation biology : the journal of the Society for Conservation Biology
LA English
DT Review
AB Population viability analysis ( PVA) has become a commonly used tool in  endangered species management. There is no single process that constitutes PVA,  but all approaches have in common an assessment of a population's risk of  extinction (or quasi extinction) or its projected population growth either under  current conditions or expected from proposed management. As model sophistication  increases, and software programs that facilitate PVA without the need for  modeling expertise become more available, there is greater potential for the  misuse of models and increased confusion over interpreting their results.  Consequently, we discuss the practical use and limitations of PVA in conservation  planning, and we discuss some emerging issues of PVA. We review extant issues  that have become prominent in PVA, including spatially explicit modeling,  sensitivity analysis, incorporating genetics into PVA, PVA in plants, and PVA  software packages, but our coverage of emerging issues is not comprehensive. We  conclude that PVA is a powerful tool in conservation biology for comparing  alternative research plans and relative extinction risks among species, but we  suggest caution in its use: (1) because PVA is a model, its validity depends on  the appropriateness of the model's structure and data quality; (2) results should  be presented with appropriate assessment of confidence; (3) model construction  and results should be subject to external review, and (4) model structure, input,  and results should be treated as hypotheses to be tested. We also suggest (5)  restricting the definition of PVA to development of a formal quantitative model,  (6) focusing more research on determining how pervasive density-dependence  feedback is across species, and (7) not using PVA to determine minimum population  size or (8) the specific probability of reaching extinction. The most appropriate  use of PVA may be for comparing the relative effects of potential management  actions on population growth or persistence.

TI Animal genetic resources in Brazil: result of five centuries of natural
SO Theriogenology
LA English
DT Review
AB Brazil has various species of domestic animals, which developed from breeds  brought by the Portuguese settlers soon after their discovery. For five  centuries, these breeds have been subjected to natural selection in specific  environments. Today, they present characteristics adapted to the specific  Brazilian environmental conditions. These breeds developed in Brazil are known as  "Crioulo," "local," or naturalized. From the beginning of the 20th century, some  exotic breeds, selected in temperate regions, have begun to be imported. Although  more productive, these breeds do not have adaptive traits, such as resistance to  disease and parasites found in breeds considered to be "native." Even so, little  by little, they replaced the native breeds, to such an extent that the latter are  in danger of extinction. In 1983, to avoid the loss of this important genetic  material, the National Research Center for Genetic Resources and Biotechnology  (Cenargen) of the Brazilian Agricultural Research Corporation (Embrapa) decided  to include conservation of animal genetic resources in its research program  Conservation and Utilization of Genetic Resources. Until this time, they were  only concerned with conservation of native plants. Conservation has been carried  out by various research centers of Embrapa, universities, state research  corporations, and private farmers, with a single coordinator at the national  level, Cenargen. Specifically, conservation is being carried out by conservation  nuclei, which are specific herds in which the animals are being conserved,  situated in the habitats where the animals have been subjected to natural  selection. This involves storage of semen and embryos from cattle, horses,  buffaloes, donkeys, goats, sheep, and pigs. The Brazilian Animal Germplasm Bank  is kept at Cenargen, which is responsible for the storage of semen and embryos of  various breeds of domestic animals threatened with extinction, where almost  45,000 doses of semen and more than 200 embryos exist presently. An important  challenge for this program is to make the different segments of society realize  the importance of the conservation of animal genetic resources.

TI Australasian marsupials--to cherish and to hold.
SO Reproduction, fertility, and development
LA English
DT Review
AB Considerable interchange of mammals between South America and Australasia  occurred during the first half of the Tertiary, including the presence of  placental mammals in Australia. This challenges the old assumption that the  marsupial radiation in Australia was made possible by the absence of placental  competition, and suggests that two properties of marsupial organization may have  favoured their survival in the increasingly arid climates that developed after  the separation of Australasia from Antarctica. The basal metabolic rates of  marsupials are about 70% of equivalent placentals, so their maintenance  requirements for energy, nitrogen and water are lower, whereas their field  metabolic rates are about the same, which means that they have a greater  metabolic scope to call on when active. This may have given marsupials an  advantage in semi-arid environments. The lengthy and complex lactation of  marsupials enables the female to exploit limited resources over an extended  period without compromising the survival of the young. Both these properties of  marsupials enabled them to survive the double constraints of low fertility soils  and the uncertain climate of Australia throughout the Tertiary. The arrival of  people was followed first by the extinction of the large marsupials and, much  later, by the wholesale decline or extinction of the small-to-medium sized  species. The common factor in both extinctions may have been the constraints of  marsupial reproduction.

TI CO2 and the end-Triassic mass extinction.
SO Nature
LA English
DT Letter
AB The end of the Triassic period was marked by one of the largest and most  enigmatic mass-extinction events in Earth's history and, with few reliable marine  geochemical records, terrestrial sediments offer an important means of  deciphering environmental changes at this time. Tanner et al. describe an  isotopic study of Mesozoic fossil soils which suggests that the atmospheric  concentration of carbon dioxide (pCO2) across the Triassic-Jurassic boundary was  relatively constant (within 250 p.p.m.v.), but this is inconsistent with  high-resolution evidence from the stomatal characters of fossil leaves. Here I  show that the temporal resolution of the fossil-soil samples may have been  inadequate for detecting a transient rise in pCO2. I also show that the  fossil-soil data are consistent with a large increase in pCO2 across the  Triassic-Jurassic boundary when variations in the stable carbon isotope (denoted  as delta13C) in terrestrial plant leaves are taken into account. These factors  suggest that the linkage between pCO2, global warming and the end-Triassic mass  extinction remains intact.

TI Variable effort harvesting models in random environments: generalization to
SO Mathematical biosciences
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB In a previous paper [Math. Biosci. 156 (1999) 1], we have studied quite general  stochastic differential equation models for the growth of populations subjected  to harvesting in a random environment. We have obtained conditions for  non-extinction and for the existence of stationary distributions (as well as  expressions for such distributions) similar to conditions for non-extinction and  for the existence of a stable equilibrium in the corresponding deterministic  model. The models were quite general, considering density-dependent natural  growth functions and harvesting policies of very general form, so that our  results would be model independent and provide minimal requirements for the  choice of a wise density-dependent harvesting policy. Those models, however,  although quite general on all other respects, have a serious limitation. In fact,  the ways environmental fluctuations affect the population per capita growth rate  are poorly known and those models only considered two possible ways, namely the  noise intensity could be constant or proportional to that rate. To overcome this  limitation, in this paper we generalize the previous results to density-dependent  positive noise intensities of very general form so that they also become  independent from the way environmental fluctuations affect population growth  rates.

TI An analysis of dinosaurian biogeography: evidence for the existence of vicariance
SO Proceedings. Biological sciences
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB As the supercontinent Pangaea fragmented during the Mesozoic era, dinosaur faunas  were divided into isolated populations living on separate continents. It has been  predicted, therefore, that dinosaur distributions should display a branching  ('vicariance') pattern that corresponds with the sequence and timing of  continental break-up. Several recent studies, however, minimize the importance of  plate tectonics and instead suggest that dispersal and regional extinction were  the main controls on dinosaur biogeography. Here, in order to test the vicariance  hypothesis, we apply a cladistic biogeographical method to a large dataset on  dinosaur relationships and distributions. We also introduce a methodological  refinement termed 'time-slicing', which is shown to be a key step in the  detection of ancient biogeographical patterns. These analyses reveal  biogeographical patterns that closely correlate with palaeogeography. The results  provide the first statistically robust evidence that, from Middle Jurassic to  mid-Cretaceous times, tectonic events had a major role in determining where and  when particular dinosaur groups flourished. The fact that evolutionary trees for  extinct organisms preserve such distribution patterns opens up a new and fruitful  direction for palaeobiogeographical research.

TI Long-term persistence of species and the SLOSS problem.
SO Journal of theoretical biology
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB The single large or several small (SLOSS) problem has been addressed in a large  number of empirical and theoretical studies, but no coherent conclusion has yet  been reached. Here I study the SLOSS problem in the context of metapopulation  dynamics. I assume that there is a fixed total amount A(0) of habitat available,  and I derive formulas for the optimal number n and area A of habitat patches,  where n=A(0)/A. I consider optimality in two ways. First, I attempt to maximize  the time to metapopulation extinction, which is a relevant measure for  metapopulation viability for rare and threatened species. Second, I attempt to  maximize the metapopulation capacity of the habitat patch network, which  corresponds both with maximizing the distance to the deterministic extinction  threshold and with maximizing the fraction of occupied patches. I show that in  the typical case, a small number of large patches maximizes the metapopulation  capacity, while an intermediate number of habitat patches maximizes the time to  extinction. The main conclusion stemming from the analysis is that the optimal  number of patches is largely affected by the relationship between habitat patch  area and rates of immigration, emigration and local extinction. Here this  relationship is summarized by a single factor zeta, termed the patch area scaling  factor.

TI Non-equilibria in small metapopulations: comparing the deterministic Levins model
SO Journal of theoretical biology
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB In this paper, we examine, for small metapopulations, the stochastic analog of  the classical Levins metapopulation model. We study its basic model output, the  expected time to metapopulation extinction, for systems which are brought out of  equilibrium by imposing sudden changes in patch number and the colonization and  extinction parameters. We find that the expected metapopulation extinction time  shows different behavior from the relaxation time of the original, deterministic,  Levins model. This relaxation time is therefore limited in value for predicting  the behavior of the stochastic model. However, predictions about the extinction  time for deterministically unviable cases remain qualitatively the same. Our  results further suggest that, if we want to counteract the effects of habitat  loss or increased dispersal resistance, the optimal conservation strategy is not  to restore the original situation, that is, to create habitat or decrease  resistance against dispersal. As long as the costs for different management  options are not too dissimilar, it is better to improve the quality of the  remaining habitat in order to decrease the local extinction rate.

SO Molecular biology and evolution

DT Journal Article
AB Species-level phylogenies derived from DNA sequence data provide a tool for  estimating diversification rates and how these rates change over time, but to  date there have been few empirical studies, particularly on insect groups. We use  a densely sampled phylogenetic tree based on mitochondrial DNA to investigate  diversification rates in the North American tiger beetles (genus Cicindela).  Using node ages estimated from sequence data and calibrated by biogeographical  evidence, we estimate an average per-lineage diversification rate of at least  0.22 +/- 0.08 species/Myr over the time interval since the most recent  colonization that led to a radiation within the continent. In addition, we find  evidence for a weak, recent increase in the net diversification rate. This is  more consistent with a late Pleistocene increase in the speciation rate than with  a constant rate of background extinction, but the results are sensitive to the  dating method and taxon sampling. We discuss practical limitations to  phylogenetic studies of diversification rates.

TI Evolution of cannibalistic traits: scenarios derived from adaptive dynamics.
SO Theoretical population biology
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB The evolution of cannibalistic traits in consumer populations is studied in this  paper with the approach of adaptive dynamics theory. The model is kept at its  minimum complexity by eliminating some environmental characteristics, like  heterogeneity and seasonalities, and by hiding the size-structure of the  population. Evolutionary dynamics are identified through numerical bifurcation  analysis, applied both to the ecological (resident-mutant) model and to the  canonical equation of adaptive dynamics. The result is a rich catalog of  evolutionary scenarios involving evolutionary stable strategies and branching  points both in the monomorphic and dimorphic dynamics. The possibility of  evolutionary extinction of highly cannibalistic populations is also ascertained.  This allows one to explain why cannibalism can be a transient stage of evolution.

TI Examination of hypotheses for the Permo-Triassic boundary extinction by carbon
SO Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB The biological extinction that occurred at the Permian-Triassic boundary  represents the most extensive loss of species of any known event of the past 550  million years. There have been a wide variety of explanations offered for this  extinction. In the present paper, a number of the more popular recent hypotheses  are evaluated in terms of predictions that they make, or that they imply,  concerning the global carbon cycle. For this purpose, a mass balance model is  used that calculates atmospheric CO2 and oceanic delta13C as a function of time.  Hypotheses considered include: (i) the release of massive amounts of CO2 from the  ocean to the atmosphere resulting in mass poisoning; (ii) the release of large  amounts of CO2 from volcanic degassing; (iii) the release of methane stored in  methane hydrates; (iv) the decomposition and oxidation of dead organisms to CO2  after sudden mass mortality; and (v) the long-term reorganization of the global  carbon cycle. The modeling indicates that measured short-term changes in delta13C  at the boundary are best explained by methane release with mass mortality and  volcanic degassing contributing in secondary roles. None of the processes result  in excessively high levels of atmospheric CO2 if they occurred on time scales of  more than about 1,000 years. The idea of poisoning by high levels of atmospheric  CO2 depends on the absence of subthermocline calcium carbonate deposition during  the latest Permian. The most far-reaching effect was found to be reorganization  of the carbon cycle with major sedimentary burial of organic matter shifting from  the land to the sea, resulting in less burial overall, decreased atmospheric O2,  and higher atmospheric CO2 for the entire Triassic Period.

TI When looks can kill: the evolution of sexually dimorphic floral display and the
SO Proceedings. Biological sciences
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB Dioecious plants (with separate male and female individuals) more often have  drab, inconspicuous flowers than related bisexual plants. Models indicate,  however, that similar conditions favour the evolution of showy floral displays in  dioecious and bisexual plants. One difference, however, is that dioecious plants  may evolve floral displays that are sexually dimorphic. We show that males are  more likely to evolve showy flowers than females in animal-pollinated plants,  especially when pollinators are abundant. We demonstrate that this dimorphism  places showy dioecious plants at a much higher risk of extinction during years of  low pollinator abundance because pollinators may fail to visit female flowers.  The higher extinction risk of showy dioecious plants provides an explanation for  the fact that dioecious plants that do persist tend to have inconspicuous flowers  and are more often wind pollinated. It may also help explain why dioecious plants  are less species-rich than related bisexual plants.

TI The population ecology of contemporary adaptations: what empirical studies reveal
SO Genetica
LA English
DT Review
AB Under what conditions might organisms be capable of rapid adaptive evolution? We  reviewed published studies documenting contemporary adaptations in natural  populations and looked for general patterns in the population ecological causes.  We found that studies of contemporary adaptation fall into two general settings:  (1) colonization of new environments that established newly adapted populations,  and (2) local adaptations within the context of a heterogeneous environments and  metapopulation structure. Local ecological processes associated with  colonizations and introductions included exposure to: (1) a novel host or food  resource; (2) a new biophysical environment; (3) a new predator community; and  (4) a new coexisting competitor. The new environments that were colonized often  had depauperate communities, sometimes because of anthropogenic disturbance.  Local adaptation in heterogeneous environments was also often associated with  recent anthropogenic changes, such as insecticide and herbicide resistance, or  industrial melanism. A common feature of many examples is the combination of  directional selection with at least a short-term opportunity for population  growth. We suggest that such opportunities for population growth may be a key  factor that promotes rapid evolution, since directional selection might otherwise  be expected to cause population decline and create the potential for local  extinction, which is an ever-present alternative to local adaptation. We also  address the large discrepancy between the rate of evolution observed in  contemporary studies and the apparent rate of evolution seen in the fossil  record.

TI A single ancient origin of brood parasitism in African finches: implications for
SO Evolution; international journal of organic evolution
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB Robust phylogenies for brood-parasitic birds, their hosts, and nearest nesting  relatives provide the framework to address historical questions about  host-parasite coevolution and the origins of parasitic behavior. We tested  phylogenetic hypotheses for the two genera of African brood-parasitic finches,  Anomalospiza and Vidua, using mitochondrial DNA sequence data from 43 passeriform  species. Our analyses strongly support a sister relationship between Vidua and  Anomalospiza, leading to the conclusion that obligate brood parasitism evolved  only once in African finches rather than twice, as has been the conventional  view. In addition, the parasitic finches (Viduidae) are not recently derived from  either weavers (Ploceidae) or grassfinches (Estrildidae), but represent a third  distinct lineage. Among these three groups, the parasitic finches and estrildids,  which includes the hosts of all 19 Vidua species, are sister taxa in all analyses  of our full dataset. Many characters shared by Vidua and estrildids, including  elaborate mouth markings in nestlings, unusual begging behavior, and immaculate  white eggs, can therefore be attributed to common ancestry rather than convergent  evolution. The host-specificity of mouth mimicry in Vidua species, however, is  clearly the product of subsequent host-parasite coevolution. The lineage leading  to Anomalospiza switched to parasitizing more distantly related Old World  warblers (Sylviidae) and subsequently lost these characteristics. Substantial  sequence divergence between Vidua and Anomalospiza indicates that the origin of  parasitic behavior in this clade is ancient (approximately 20 million years ago),  a striking contrast to the recent radiation of extant Vidua. We suggest that the  parasitic finch lineage has experienced repeated cycles of host colonization,  speciation, and extinction through their long history as brood parasites and that  extant Vidua species represent only the latest iterations of this process. This  dynamic process may account for a significantly faster rate of DNA sequence  evolution in parasitic finches as compared to estrildids and other passerines.  Our study reduces by one the tally of avian lineages in which obligate brood  parasitism has evolved and suggests an origin of parasitism that involved  relatively closely related species likely to accept and provide appropriate care  to parasitic young. Given the ancient origin of parasitism in African finches,  ancestral estrildids must have been parasitized well before the diversification  of extant Vidua, suggesting a long history of coevolution between these lineages  preceding more recent interactions between specific hosts and parasites.

TI Cheating and the evolutionary stability of mutualisms.
SO Proceedings. Biological sciences
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB Interspecific mutualisms have been playing a central role in the functioning of  all ecosystems since the early history of life. Yet the theory of coevolution of  mutualists is virtually nonexistent, by contrast with well-developed  coevolutionary theories of competition, predator-prey and host-parasite  interactions. This has prevented resolution of a basic puzzle posed by  mutualisms: their persistence in spite of apparent evolutionary instability. The  selective advantage of 'cheating', that is, reaping mutualistic benefits while  providing fewer commodities to the partner species, is commonly believed to erode  a mutualistic interaction, leading to its dissolution or reciprocal extinction.  However, recent empirical findings indicate that stable associations of  mutualists and cheaters have existed over long evolutionary periods. Here, we  show that asymmetrical competition within species for the commodities offered by  mutualistic partners provides a simple and testable ecological mechanism that can  account for the long-term persistence of mutualisms. Cheating, in effect,  establishes a background against which better mutualists can display any  competitive superiority. This can lead to the coexistence and divergence of  mutualist and cheater phenotypes, as well as to the coexistence of ecologically  similar, but unrelated mutualists and cheaters.

AB Molluscan faunal turnover in the Plio-Pleistocene of the tropical western  Atlantic has been attributed to drops in temperature or primary productivity, but  these competing hypotheses have not been assessed ecologically. To test these  alternatives, we compiled data on changing molluscan life habits and trophic  composition over 12 million years derived from 463 newly made collections from  the southwestern Caribbean. Shelf ecosystems have altered markedly in trophic  structure since the Late Pliocene. Predatory gastropods and suspension-feeding  bivalves declined significantly in abundance, but not in diversity, and  reef-dwellers became common. By contrast, all other ecological life habits  remained remarkably stable. Food-web changes strongly support the hypothesis that  declining regional nutrient supply had an increasing impact on regional  macroecology, culminating in a faunal turnover.

DT Journal Article
AB The history of life, which appeared more than 500 million years ago, has been  characterized by a constant faunal and floral turnover. On five occasions, the  background extinctions has become a mass extinction (ME), i.e. a major biotic  crisis collapsing the upward curve of the biodiversity. The mass extinction of  the end of the Permian is the most murderous but the end-Cretaceous one, which  experiences dinosaur's death, is the most well-known. In fact, these  land-dwelling reptiles with upright limbs, as well as the pterosaurs, the  mosasaurs and numerous invertebrates die as far as the last. There exists a lot  of hypotheses tending to explain their death but they are often extravagant  and/or impossible to be verified. The last one, referring to a collapse between  the earth and a heavenly large bolide has given rise, since more than 20 years,  to heated debates between catastrophists and gradualists, even if the reality of  the impact seems no more doubtful (discovery of Chicxulub impact crater, iridium  anomaly, tektite glass, shocked quartz, spinels with high nickel concentrations).  It is now the extent of the deleterious effects (regional or worldwide  repercussion) which is debating. By referring to the obtained data in oceanic  environment and, if necessary, in terrestrial environment where fossil record is  too often incomplete, it can be noticed an important fact corresponding to a  selective character of extinctions, the event of the C/T boundary killing off  some taxa while others are preserved. This remark does not really correspond to  the hypothesis of a sudden planetary catastrophe of large magnitude.  Consequently, it seems to be reasonable to make arise intrinsic factors  associated to the dynamics of the globe (volcanic eruptions, marine regression,  fall of temperature) over a long period. The collapse with the Chicxulub asteroid  should then come up, especially in Western North-America, as a "coup de grâce" in  a weakened ecosystem.

TI Metapopulation models for extinction threshold in spatially correlated
SO Journal of theoretical biology
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB Simple analytical models assuming homogeneous space have been used to examine the  effects of habitat loss and fragmentation on metapopulation size. The models  predict an extinction threshold, a critical amount of suitable habitat below  which the metapopulation goes deterministically extinct. The consequences of  non-random loss of habitat for species with localized dispersal have been studied  mainly numerically. In this paper, we present two analytical approaches to the  study of habitat loss and its metapopulation dynamic consequences incorporating  spatial correlation in both metapopulation dynamics as well as in the pattern of  habitat destruction. One approach is based on a measure called metapopulation  capacity, given by the dominant eigenvalue of a "landscape" matrix, which  encapsulates the effects of landscape structure on population extinctions and  colonizations. The other approach is based on pair approximation. These models  allow us to examine analytically the effects of spatial structure in habitat loss  on the equilibrium metapopulation size and the threshold condition for  persistence. In contrast to the pair approximation based approaches, the  metapopulation capacity based approach allows us to consider species with long as  well as short dispersal range and landscapes with spatial correlation at  different scales. The two methods make dissimilar assumptions, but the broad  conclusions concerning the consequences of spatial correlation in the landscape  structure are the same. Our results show that increasing correlation in the  spatial arrangement of the remaining habitat increases patch occupancy, that this  increase is more evident for species with short-range than long-range dispersal,  and that to be most beneficial for metapopulation size, the range of spatial  correlation in landscape structure should be at least a few times greater than  the dispersal range of the species.

SO Photochemistry and photobiology
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB We have developed a new model using liposome-encapsulated fluorescent probes,  aiming at assessing both the physical and the biological protection provided by  filter molecules such as those incorporated in sunscreens. The fluorescent  indicator Indo-1 or 2',7'-dichlorofluorescin (DCFH) was inside the liposomes, in  the aqueous inner compartment, whereas the filter molecules octyl  methoxycinnamate (OMC), benzophenone-3 (BP3) or avobenzone, widely used in  sunscreens, were incorporated into liposome membranes. When liposome suspensions  were placed in a fluorometer cuvette exposed to an incident UV beam, the decrease  of Indo-1 fluorescence as a function of filter concentration was related to the  extinction coefficient of the filters. On the other hand, when liposome  suspensions were exposed to moderate UVB doses allowing Indo-1 photobleaching,  the remaining intact Indo-1 was linked to the protection provided by  filter-containing liposome membranes. Finally, when liposome-encapsulated DCFH  was exposed to UVB, the degree of photo-oxidation of the fluorescent probe into  2',7'-dichlorofluorescein accounted for the photoprotection provided by the  filter contained in liposome membranes. BP3 was more potent and slightly less  efficient than the other two filters in preventing Indo-1 fluorescence; all three  filters provided a similar concentration-dependent protection of Indo-1  photobleaching, whereas only OMC was able to prevent the photooxidation of DCFH.  The liposome model presented here has the advantage of combining both physical  and biological parameters to assess the photoprotection provided by filter  molecules, and the lack of photoprotection by two sunscreen molecules having a  good filter capacity highlights the need for such a biological parameter when  talking about the safety of sunscreens.

TI History and timing of human impact on Lake Victoria, East Africa.
SO Proceedings. Biological sciences

DT Journal Article
AB Lake Victoria, the largest tropical lake in the world, suffers from severe  eutrophication and the probable extinction of up to half of its 500+ species of  endemic cichlid fishes. The continuing degradation of Lake Victoria's ecological  functions has serious long-term consequences for the ecosystem services it  provides, and may threaten social welfare in the countries bordering its shores.  Evaluation of recent ecological changes in the context of aquatic food-web  alterations, catchment disturbance and natural ecosystem variability has been  hampered by the scarcity of historical monitoring data. Here, we present  high-resolution palaeolimnological data, which show that increases in  phytoplankton production developed from the 1930s onwards, which parallels  human-population growth and agricultural activity in the Lake Victoria drainage  basin. Dominance of bloom-forming cyanobacteria since the late 1980s coincided  with a relative decline in diatom growth, which can be attributed to the seasonal  depletion of dissolved silica resulting from 50 years of enhanced diatom growth  and burial. Eutrophication-induced loss of deep-water oxygen started in the early  1960s, and may have contributed to the 1980s collapse of indigenous fish stocks  by eliminating suitable habitat for certain deep-water cichlids. Conservation of  Lake Victoria as a functioning ecosystem is contingent upon large-scale  implementation of improved land-use practices.

TI Mass extinctions, biodiversity explosions and ecological niches.
SO Comptes rendus biologies
LA English
DT Review
AB The logistic model proposed by Courtillot and Gaudemer to describe the growth of  biodiversity during geological ages is more explored here and further developed.  A new parameterisation is first proposed. Another expression of this model is  obtained by introducing a new variable representing the number of ecological  niches. It appears that the rates of increase of biodiversity during Jurassic and  Cretaceous periods is quite different from other ones. The classical literature  essentially focuses on possible extinction mechanisms, but explosions in  biodiversity must be more precisely explored. For this purpose, on the basis of  data analysis through different expressions of the logistic model, different  ecological mechanisms can be assumed (e.g., qualitative and quantitative niches  changes, possible appearance of new kinds of ecological relationships, such as  'niche-sharing', which involves coexistence or cooperation), even if genetic  processes must also be involved. Finally, we emphasise the astonishing speed of  biological diversification following a 'catastrophic' mass extinction. We could  refer to this feature as 'catastrophic biological diversification'.

TI A fecundity to mortality ratio, population size variability and the chance for a
SO Zhurnal obshchei biologii
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB How is a species' propensity to vary in size over time related to its chances to  be listed on the Red List (Red Book), that is to face the risk of extinction?  Here I suggest that the linkage between the range of population fluctuations and  chance of listing may be established on the basis of the ratio of species' annual  fecundity to annual mortality of adults, B/M. For 23 mammalian species inhabiting  the vast tracts of Western Siberia, the range of population fluctuations is found  to be equal or at least proportional to B/M. Further, this ratio is estimated for  a larger set of 90 mammalian species from the territory and coastal waters of the  former Soviet Union, of which 25 species are listed in the Red Book of the USSR.  The distribution of the Red Book species over the gradient of B/M is clearly  non-uniform: most of them have low B/M, which leads to a negative relationship  between chance of listing and B/M. The positive relation between population size  variability and B/M and the negative relation between chance of listing and B/M  suggest the resulting negative relation between chance of listing and population  size variability. Both the positive and the negative relations of, respectively,  population size variability and chance of listing on B/M are logically justified  since B/M is a measure of the population growth rate: it is the total lifetime  offspring and an upper estimate of the growth rate per generation time.  Fast-growing, more resilient species tend to be more resistant to extinction and  hence to have low chance of listing, but simultaneously are able to fluctuate  widely. Thus, so long as population growth rate affects both chance of listing  and population size variability, high variability implies low chance of listing.

TI How many named species are valid?
SO Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB Estimates of biodiversity in both living and fossil groups depend on raw counts  of currently recognized named species, but many of these names eventually will  prove to be synonyms or otherwise invalid. This difficult bias can be resolved  with a simple "flux ratio" equation that compares historical rates of  invalidation and revalidation. Flux ratio analysis of a taxonomic data set of  unrivalled completeness for 4,861 North American fossil mammal species shows that  24-31% of currently accepted names eventually will prove invalid, so diversity  estimates are inflated by 32-44%. The estimate is conservative compared with one  obtained by using an older, more basic method. Although the degree of inflation  varies through both historical and evolutionary time, it has a minor impact on  previously published background origination and extinction rates. Several lines  of evidence suggest that the same bias probably affects more poorly studied,  hyperdiverse living groups such as fungi and insects. If so, then current  estimates of total global diversity could be revised downwards to as low as  3.5-10.5 million species.

TI Secular growth and its harmful ramifications.
SO Medical hypotheses
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB Secular growth has been occurring in Europe for about 150 years. In the USA,  since 1900, each new generation has increased by an average of 1in (2.54cm) in  height and about 10lb (4.54kg) in weight. This trend has generally been viewed as  favorable and tallness is admired, with the current ideal height for a man in the  Western world being 6ft 2in (188cm). The Japanese have increased in height since  the end of the Second World War by about 5in (12.7cm) in height and the Chinese  have been growing at the rate of 2.54cm/decade since the 1950s. In spite of  admiring greater height, a world population of increasing height and body-weight  is a major threat to our environment, health and survival. Based on more than two  decades of research, quantitative data are given for increased use of resources,  and increased pollution, energy and fiscal costs resulting from a population of  larger people. The laws of scaling are described to show why the impact of  increasing stature has a non-linear impact on consumption, body-weight, strength,  pollution and economic costs. Paleontological findings indicating that larger  body size increases the risk of extinction are also discussed. Various studies  indicate a loss of 0.47 year of longevity for each cm increment of height.  Caloric restricted diets are also reviewed for their applicability to humans.  Recommendations are made for dietary practices to moderate growth in our youth  and to postpone development of chronic or degenerative diseases.

TI Escalation and extinction selectivity: morphology versus isotopic reconstruction
SO Evolution; international journal of organic evolution
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB Studies that have tested and failed to support the hypothesis that escalated  species (e.g., those with predation-resistant adaptations) are more susceptible  to elimination during mass extinctions have concentrated on the distribution and  degree of morphological defenses in molluscan species. This morphological  approach to determining level of escalation in bivalves may be oversimplified  because it does not account for metabolic rate, which is an important measure of  escalation that is less readily accessible for fossils. Shell growth rates in  living bivalves are positively correlated with metabolic rate and thus are  potential indicators of level of escalation. To evaluate this approach, we used  oxygen isotopes to reconstruct shell growth rates for two bivalve species  (Macrocallista marylandica and Glossus markoei) from Miocene-aged sediments of  Maryland. Although both species are classified as non-escalated based on  morphology, the isotopic data indicate that M. marylandica was a faster-growing  species with a higher metabolic rate and G. markoei was a slower-growing species  with a lower metabolic rate. Based on these results, we predict that some  morphologically non-escalated species in previous tests of extinction selectivity  should be reclassified as escalated because of their fast shell growth rates  (i.e., high metabolic rates). Studies that evaluate the level of escalation of a  fauna should take into account the energetic physiology of taxa to avoid  misleading results.

TI How old is the Hawaiian biota? Geology and phylogeny suggest recent divergence.
SO Proceedings. Biological sciences
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB This study quantifies long-term landscape changes in the Hawaiian archipelago  relating to dispersal, speciation and extinction. Accounting for volcano growth,  subsidence and erosion, we modelled the elevations of islands at time intervals  of 0.5 Myr for the last 32 Myr; we also assessed the variation in the spacing of  volcanoes during this period. The size, spacing and total number of volcanic  islands have varied greatly over time, with the current landscape of large,  closely spaced islands preceded by a period with smaller, more distantly spaced  islands. Considering associated changes in rates of dispersal and speciation,  much of the present species pool is probably the result of recent colonization  from outside the archipelago and divergence within contemporary islands, with  limited dispersal from older islands. This view is in accordance with abundant  phylogenetic studies of Hawaiian organisms that estimate the timing of  colonization and divergence within the archipelago. Twelve out of 15  multi-species lineages have diverged within the lifetime of the current high  islands (last 5 Myr). Three of these, and an additional seven (mostly  single-species) lineages, have colonized the archipelago within this period. The  timing of colonization of other lineages remains uncertain.

TI Local adaptation in the Linum marginale-Melampsora lini host-pathogen
SO Evolution; international journal of organic evolution
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB The potential for local adaptation between pathogens and their hosts has  generated strong theoretical and empirical interest with evidence both for and  against local adaptation reported for a range of systems. We use the Linum  marginale-Melampsora lini plant-pathogen system and a hierarchical spatial  structure to investigate patterns of local adaptation within a metapopulation  characterised by epidemic dynamics and frequent extinction of pathogen  populations. Based on large sample sizes and comprehensive cross-inoculation  trials, our analyses demonstrate strong local adaptation by Melampsora to its  host populations, with this effect being greatest at regional scales, as  predicted from the broader spatial scales at which M. lini disperses relative to  L. marginale. However, there was no consistent trend for more distant pathogen  populations to perform more poorly. Our results further show how the  coevolutionary interaction between hosts and pathogens can be influenced by local  structure such that resistant hosts select for generally virulent pathogens,  while susceptible hosts select for more avirulent pathogens. Empirically, local  adaptation has generally been tested in two contrasting ways: (1) pathogen  performance on sympatric versus allopatric hosts; and (2) sympatric versus  allopatric pathogens on a given host population. In situations where no host  population is more resistant or susceptible than others when averaged across  pathogen populations (and likewise, no pathogen population is more virulent or  avirulent than others), results from these tests should generally be congruent.  We argue that this is unlikely to be the case in the metapopulation situations  that predominate in natural host-pathogen interactions, thus requiring tests that  control simultaneously for variation in plant and pathogen populations.

AB Myotragus balearicus was a dwarf artiodactyl endemic to the Eastern Balearic  Islands, where it evolved in isolation for more than 5 million years before  becoming extinct between 3640 and 2135 cal BC (calibrated years BC). Numerous  unusual apomorphies obscure the relationship between Myotragus and the extant  Caprinae. Therefore, genetic data for this species would significantly contribute  to the clarification of its taxonomic position. In this study, we amplify,  sequence, and clone a 338-base pair (bp) segment of the mitochondrial cytochrome  b (cyt b) gene from a >9Kyr Myotragus subfossil from la Cova des Gorgs  (Mallorca). Our results confirm the phylogenetic affinity of Myotragus with the  sheep (Ovis) and the takin (Budorcas). In each tree, the Myotragus branch is long  in comparison with the other taxa, which may be evidence of a local change in the  rate of evolution in cyt b. This rate change may be due to in part to an early  age of first reproduction and short generation time in Myotragus, factors that  are potentially related to the extreme reduction in size of the adult Myotragus  as compared to the other Caprinae.

TI A review of the population biology and host-parasite interactions of the sea
SO Parasitology
LA English
DT Review
AB Lepeophtheirus salmonis is a specific parasite of salmonids that occurs in the  Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. When infestations are heavy fish mortality can occur  although the factors that are responsible for causing epizootics, especially in  wild salmonid populations are still largely unknown. Over the past 20 years this  parasite has caused significant economic losses in farmed salmon production and  possibly in wild salmonid populations locally. Understanding the connectivity  between populations is crucial to an understanding of the epidemiology of  infections and for management of infections in aquaculture. Data from genetics,  pesticide resistance, larval dispersal models and spatial and temporal patterns  of infestation in wild and farmed hosts suggests a spatially highly structured  metapopulation the components of which have different levels of connectivity,  probabilities of extinction and influence on the development of local  infestations. The population structure is defined mainly by the dispersal  dynamics of the planktonic stages and the behaviour of the host. Until recently  virtually nothing was known about the relationship between the parasite and the  host, or how the host may influence lice at local or population level. Typically,  impacts on the host have usually been reported in terms of pathological lesions  caused by attachment and feeding of the adult stages, as well as localised mild  epithelial responses to juvenile attachment. However many studies report  pathology associated with severe infestation. Recent new studies on the  host-parasite interactions of L. salmonis have shown that this parasite induces  stress-related responses systemically in the host skin and gills and that the  stress response and immune systems are modulated. In the second part of this  review, these new studies are presented, together with results from other  host-parasite model systems where data for caligid sea lice are missing. One of  the most revealing methods reported recently is the application of a net  confinement stressor to examine modulation of the stress response and immune  system of the host fish. This approach has shown that although until now,  infective stages of L. salmonis were not thought to affect the host, they do  induce systematic effects in the host that result in a stress response and  modulated immune system. Host-parasite interactions affecting these stress  responses and the immune system may be key factors in facilitating epizootics by  reducing the host's ability to reject the parasites, as well as reducing disease  resistance under some environmental conditions. The host-parasite interaction  therefore needs to be incorporated into any model of population structure and  dynamics.

TI Extinction dynamics in mainland-island metapopulations: an N-patch stochastic
SO Bulletin of mathematical biology
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB A generalization of the well-known Levins' model of metapopulations is studied.  The generalization consists of (i) the introduction of immigration from a  mainland, and (ii) assuming the dynamics is stochastic, rather than  deterministic. A master equation, for the probability that n of the patches are  occupied, is derived and the stationary probability Ps(n), together with the mean  and higher moments in the stationary state, determined. The time-dependence of  the probability distribution is also studied: through a Gaussian approximation  for general n when the boundary at n = 0 has little effect, and by calculating  P(0, t), the probability that no patches are occupied at time t, by using a  linearization procedure. These analytic calculations are supplemented by carrying  out numerical solutions of the master equation and simulations of the stochastic  process. The various approaches are in very good agreement with each other. This  allows us to use the forms for Ps(0) and P(0,t) in the linearization  approximation as a basis for calculating the mean time for a metapopulation to  become extinct. We give an analytical expression for the mean time to extinction  derived within a mean field approach. We devise a simple method to apply our mean  field approach even to complex patch networks in realistic model metapopulations.  After studying two spatially extended versions of this nonspatial metapopulation  model--a lattice metapopulation model and a spatially realistic model--we  conclude that our analytical formula for the mean extinction time is generally  applicable to those metapopulations which are really endangered, where extinction  dynamics dominates over local colonization processes. The time evolution and, in  particular, the scope of our analytical results, are studied by comparing these  different models with the analytical approach for various values of the  parameters: the rates of immigration from the mainland, the rates of colonization  and extinction, and the number of patches making up the metapopulation.

TI The use of Markovian metapopulation models: a comparison of three methods
SO Theoretical population biology
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB The use of Markovian models is an established way for deriving the complete  distribution of the size of a population and the probability of extinction.  However, computationally impractical transition matrices frequently result if  this mathematical approach is applied to natural populations. Binning, or  aggregating population sizes, has been used to permit a reduction in the  dimensionality of matrices. Here, we present three deterministic binning methods  and study the errors due to binning for a metapopulation model. Our results  indicate that estimation errors of the investigated methods are not consistent  and one cannot make generalizations about the quality of a method. For some  compared output variables of populations studied, binning methods that caused a  strong reduction in dimensionality of matrices resulted in better estimations  than methods that produced a weaker reduction. The main problem with  deterministic binning methods is that they do not properly take into account the  stochastic population process itself. Straightforward usage of binning methods  may lead to substantial errors in population-dynamical predictions.

TI The Scaphopoda.
SO Advances in marine biology
LA English
DT Review
AB The Scaphopoda are marine infaunal carnivores that feed on foraminiferans and  other microorganisms selected and manipulated by their unique feeding tentacles  or captacula. Their tusk-like shell is open at both ends; the burrowing foot and  captacula protrude anteriorly, while respiratory currents pass through the  posterior opening. Although the scaphopods comprise one of the smallest molluskan  classes in terms of species diversity, they have a worldwide distribution ranging  from intertidal to depths in excess of 6000 m. Despite detailed monographic work  from the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, however, the biology of  scaphopods is today among the least understood of mollusks. To some extent, this  is related to a significant departure from more typical molluscan organization  inferred from studies of the larger classes. For example, the mantle cavity is  elongate and restricted in space, and several associated organs are lost,  including the osphradium and ctenidia; the latter is associated with the loss of  auricles from the scaphopod heart. There is also little record of ontogeny in the  adult shell, as the older portion is periodically decollated to maintain the  posterior aperture for passage of inhalant and exhalant currents. This and other  constraints on scaphopod diversification are reflected in the range limits of  shell shape within the class. In contrast, the "Dentalium" egg has been a model  system for experimental embryology, particularly in studies of cell lineage and  early morphogenesis. Later larval development and most organogenesis is  nonetheless poorly known, although recent studies have considerably enhanced our  knowledge in this area. Global biogeographic patterns of scaphopod diversity have  been studied only preliminarily. A general decrease in diversity with depth is  broken by small diversity peaks at bathyal depths. There is also evidence for a  marked latitudinal diversity gradient in the world's oceans, near equatorial in  the Pacific but at approximately 20 degrees N in the Atlantic. Scaphopods have a  wide diversity of ecto- and endo-symbiotic associations with other organisms,  including commensal bacteria and ciliates, mutualistic anemones and corals, and  parasitic algae and platyhelminths. Other documented associations include  predation by naticid gastropods and ratfish, and the inhabitation of empty  scaphopod shells by a variety of sipunculans and hermit crabs. Phylogeny within  the class is still unresolved, although significant progress has been made  recently in documenting morphological variation among families, genera, and  species for application in a cladistic context. The evolutionary relationships of  Scaphopoda within Mollusca are farther from resolution, with every conchiferan  class a proposed sister group among modern analyses. Molecular avenues should  provide significant progress in scaphopod phylogenetics, as indicated by recent  comparative sequence analysis and gene expression patterns. Scaphopods comprise  the most recent class of mollusks to appear in the fossil record, dating at least  from the Mississippian Carboniferous (362.5 My). They appear from first-order  occurrence data to have a substantially documented fossil record, with several  sharp extinction and radiation events evident during their comparatively short  geologic history. The unresolved position of the Scaphopoda within molluscan  phylogeny, and their relatively limited range of morphological disparity but  substantial derivation from other conchiferans, renders the scaphopods an  enigmatic group. They represent a significant evolutionary avenue within the  Mollusca, but one that is poorly examined. Nonetheless, comprehensive  phylogenetic analysis and documentation of diversity within this small,  monophyletic, class-level taxon, well-preserved in the fossil record, is  imminently tractable, and presents a singular opportunity in the study of  molluscan evolution.

TI [Specificity of host-parasite relations between arthropods and terrestrial
SO Parazitologiia
LA rus
DT Review
AB Specificity of partners in host-parasite system is one of its main  characteristics. Unfortunately this term has different senses in scientific  literature. In everyday practice one judges an extent of host specificity of a  parasite mainly by indices of its occurrence and abundance on different host  species. An occurrence of parasites in nature reflects general result of complex  eco-physiological interrelationships between partners in hostparasite system.  Specificity of parasites in a choice of hosts may depend on a belonging of the  latter to certain taxa (phylogenetic specificity), or on biotic and abiotic  factors (ecological specificity). In arthropods, the phylogentic specificity and  coevolution are characteristic to a greater extent for permanent hosts (lice,  Mallophaga, cheyletoid and feather mites). A coevolutionaryphylogenesis is  disturbed by transfers of parasites onto new hosts, by different rates of  speciation in filial lines or by an extinction of several parasite taxa. In  temporary parasites different forms of ecological specificity are prevalent. A  host specificity is expressed to the lesser extent in mosquitoes, horseflies and  in other blood-sucking Diptera. In temporary parasites with a long-term feeding  (ticks) coevolutionary sequences are relatively rare, because this parasites had  to adapt not only to a life on host, but also to a lesser stable environment. In  some nest-burrow bloodsuckers (fleas, gamasid mites and argasid ticks) the  ecological specificity is shown no by their relations with certain host species,  but by an associations with habitats occupied by hosts (burrow, nests, caves). In  relation with a high dynamics of host-parasite system, a specificity of its  partners is comparative and it is kept up only under specific ecological  conditions.

SO Neuropsychiatry, neuropsychology, and behavioral neurology

DT Journal Article
AB OBJECTIVE: To characterize patterns of orienting dysfunction that were typical to  patients with lesions in the right hemisphere (RH). BACKGROUND: Brain lesions in  the right hemisphere are commonly associated with dysfunction of visual orienting  (e.g., visual neglect and extinction). In a clinical study of these symptoms, the  multicomponent nature of attentional orienting calls upon a multivariate  statistical design with careful selection of neurocognitive variables. METHODS:  Thirty-eight patients with verified brain lesions and four patients with  peripheral motor dysfunction after poliomyelitis were included in the study.  Cognitive function was evaluated in all patients. Three reaction-time (RT)  measures derived from the cue-target paradigm were selected as features in a  data-driven multivariate classification scheme to generate natural subgroups of  patients. RESULTS: Four subgroups were generated, with only RH patients allocated  to two of them. All patients within one of the RH subgroups were characterized by  a pattern of impairment earlier described as a "disengage failure" by Posner et  al. ( 5, 6), signs of visual neglect on Behavioral Inattention Test, and a  severely impaired cognitive function. Results for the other RH subgroup were  heterogeneous on both experimental and clinical variables. Age and cognitive  function were found to strongly influence two of the features, but could not  predict the clusters generated from the RT measures. CONCLUSIONS: The present  findings show that the cue-target paradigm together with multivariate clustering  of selected feature variables can serve as a useful tool to explore and  characterize patients with right hemisphere lesions. Although the concept of  "disengage failure" was suited to describe the typical RT pattern in patients  with neglect, other neurocognitive models and concepts can be applied to the  results in the current study.

TI Mechanism and biological role of nitric oxide binding to cytochrome c'.
SO Biochemistry
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB The binding of nitric oxide to ferric and ferrous Chromatium vinosum cytochrome  c' was studied. The extinction coefficients for the ferric and ferrous nitric  oxide complexes were measured. A binding model that included both a  conformational change and dissociation of the dimer into subunits provided the  best fit for the ferric cytochrome c' data. The NO (nitric oxide) binding  affinity of the WT ferric form was found to be comparable to the affinities  displayed by the ferric myoglobins and hemoglobins. Using an improved fitting  model, positive cooperativity was found for the binding of NO to the WT ferric  and ferrous forms, while anticooperativity was the case for the Y16F mutant.  Structural explanations accounting for the binding are proposed. The NO affinity  of ferrous cytochrome c' was found to be much lower than the affinities of  myoglobins, hemoglobins, and pentacoordinate heme models. Structural factors  accounting for the difference in affinities were analyzed. The NO affinity of  ferrous cytochrome c' was found to be in the range typical of receptors and  carriers. In addition, cytochrome c' was found to react with cytosolic  light-irradiated membranes in the presence of succinate and carbon monoxide. With  these results, a biochemical model of cytochrome c' functioning as a nitric oxide  carrier was proposed.

TI Animal models for information processing during sleep.
SO International journal of psychophysiology : official journal of the International
LA English
DT Review
AB Information provided by external stimuli does reach the brain during sleep,  although the amount of information is reduced during sleep compared to  wakefulness. The process controlling this reduction is called 'sensory' gating  and evidence exists that the underlying neurophysiological processes take place  in the thalamus. Furthermore, it is clear that stimuli given during sleep can  alter the functional state of the brain. Two factors have been shown to play a  crucial role in causing changes in the sleeping brain: the intensity and the  relevance of the stimulus. Intensive stimuli arouse the brain, as well as stimuli  having a high informational impact on the sleeping person. The arousal threshold  for important stimuli is quite low compared to neutral stimuli. A central  question in sleep research is whether associative learning, or in other words the  formation of new associations between stimuli, can take place in a sleeping  brain. It has been shown that simple forms of learning are still possible during  sleep. In sleeping rats, it is proven that habituation, an active, simple form of  learning not to respond to irrelevant stimuli, can occur. Moreover, there is  evidence for the view that more complex associations can be modulated and newly  formed during sleep. This is shown by two experimental approaches: an extinction  paradigm and a latent inhibition (pre-exposure) paradigm. The presentation of  non-reinforced stimuli during sleep causes slower extinction compared to the same  presentation of these stimuli during wakefulness. Consistently, the suppressive  capacity of a stimulus in the latent inhibition paradigm is less when previously  pre-exposed during sleep, as compared to pre-exposure during wakefulness. Thus,  while associative learning is not completely blocked during sleep, aspects of  association formation are clearly altered. However, animal studies also clearly  indicate that complex forms of learning are not possible during sleep. It is  hypothesised that this restriction in information processing during sleep is due  to the considerable reduction of incoming information by the sleeping brain. This  reduction may serve to protect the sleep process.

TI Recovery of polluted ecosystems: the case for long-term studies.
SO Marine environmental research
LA English
DT Journal Article
AB Recovery of marine ecosystems from pollution has tended to receive less attention  than the study of new or continuing impacts, but such studies are important in  charting recovery from acute incidents and following legislation to deal with  chronic contamination. Recovery is inevitably a long-term process, and where such  studies have been made they are often too short-lived. Interest quickly wanes  following an acute incident and governmental bodies rapidly switch to new  legislative priorities for chronic inputs. We review three case studies: recovery  of dogwhelk populations after local extinction by tributyl tin leachates from  anti-fouling paints; recovery of rocky shore communities from oil spills; and  recovery of estuarine ecosystems from industrial and urban development. We then  make some generalisations about recovery processes before making a plea for  long-term studies of polluted areas.
